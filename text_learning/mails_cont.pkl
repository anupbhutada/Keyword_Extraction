follow that standard should be evalu within a risk manag framework a valu chain approach can be use to good effect to take into account particip and distribut impact there has been littl work done to make a systemat typif of livestock valu chain who and what drive standard set standard are driven by consum with high purchas power the demand of the export market competit within the nation market

secur has been an emphasi for mani develop countri food safeti is consid veri import in develop countri but elsewher has receiv less attent food safeti need to be given increas but appropri emphasi as it is import to the poor it is not evid that risk is taken into account when assess appropri standard govern should be set the minimum nation level of risk howev the intern communiti need to help them

countri produc and consum which may creat obstacl to region trade crossbord food chain and a dramat rise in the market share of the modern retail sector in mani countri have creat a number of effect most notabl these are chang in procur system and shift toward privat safeti and qualiti standard region diversif and valu ad introduc new product and the need for new standard peopl who are not involv in ani kind of integr or concentr may not be affect by intern standard at all and they may continu to appli local standard howev if consum learn of new product or new standard this may chang the valu

deserv a higher prioriti on nation agenda more effort are need to facilit the poorest to access the negoti process that preced meet membership of intern standard set bodi and trade bloc is benefici poor produc and poor consum are unlik to have much voic in the standard set process until they becom organis and join lobbi group it is necessari to promot standard set appropri for the risk manag situat and that can actual be enforc there is a need to make more effort in help all member countri of these organ to access the sps inform system it is import that all govern use standard set as part

communic anim health and food safeti are affect by event that occur throughout the food chain use the term in a market rather than physic sens from input suppli to consum therefor the develop and

consumpt stakehold includ farmer fishermen slaughterhous oper food processor transport oper distributor wholesal and retail and consum as well as govern oblig to protect public health the holist approach to food safeti along the food chain differ from previous model in which respons for safe food tend to concentr on the food process sector n 2003a in order to assess impact on the poor it is import to use an approach that take into 2 n expert consult account particip and distribut impact a valu chain approach can be use to good effect the valu chain describ the full rang of activ which are requir to bring a product or servic from concept through the differ phase of product deliveri to final consum and final dispos after use kaplinski and morri 2000 the emerg of valu chain as the foremost organiz arrang in global food market in contrast with a suppli chain dynam where product is often insensit to market requir and the focus is exclus on effici logist a valu chain is

anim trade in bush meat there has been littl work done to make a systemat typif of livestock valu chain this would be a valuabl start point for analysi of the impact of standard the poor the consult address two dimens of poverti develop countri and poor peopl develop countri notabl lowincom countri or lic need to be singl out for special consider becaus of the extent to which they may or may not

countri will experi the effect of standard in a varieti of way their point of particip in the valu chain product trade wholes process consumpt may affect the way that they experi the impact of standard more than their physic locat eg ruralurban differ level of poverti can be seen and have been formal defin they includ the destitut often describ as below the poverti line which in the intern definit mean have an incom of less than 1 a day as well as those who are not destitut but are still vulner it is accept that there are poor peopl within rich and middleincom countri ns prioriti reflect the millennium develop goal and is like therefor to place most emphasi on poor peopl within the poorest countri howev the consult did not consid it appropri to place strict boundari around the poor for the purpos of this discuss 5 who and what drive standard set the standard impos intern and nation are driven by the need to manag risk in the food chain the demand for chang in standard is creat by driver within a countri economi while the institut structur influenc the way in which standard are defin and impos driver of standard consum with high purchas power consum are the primari driver of standard those who are veri poor are concern most with access to food as their livelihood improv they becom concern with safeti and then with other less tangibl qualiti element consum with

fair trade labor iuss rural life polit 6 n expert consult export consum in affluent countri have a major impact on standard set their prefer are express through their govern intern supermarket chain and multin food processor long vertic integr market chain origin in develop countri to suppli consum in affluent countri consum may have a disproportion role in standard set compar to produc a cultur of litig encourag retail in develop countri to pursu a zerorisk polici to demand veri high intern standard and expect govern to enforc them intern retail demand safeti standard that are at least as strict as those set by intern agreement and in some case eg organ food may be higher while other technic standard consist of appear and flavour volum anim welfar may also be veri high develop countri also have a disproportion high role in both oie and codex littl account is taken of the need and circumst of develop countri in eg set mrls for instanc develop countri and affluent consum consum on averag much higher quantiti of meat but lower quantiti of maiz than the poor in africa and mrl level reflect develop countri consumpt no altern are consid base on dietari pattern intern standard should ideal be set at level necessari for safeti but no higher or they becom unnecessarili exclusionari one exampl is the need for veri expens laboratori to test mrl level which are becom increas stringent but may not be a realist reflect of the safeti need of the consum competit on the nation market from export qualiti or local good standard impos by export can affect those in domest market exampl includ thailand where chicken for export are produc by approv farm and slaughter by approv abattoir howev some part are not export and enter the domest market where they are consum by a varieti of peopl includ the poor this has creat an expect of standard among urban consum in south africa competit from import foreign chees which is more expens than the local product but has a longer shelf life and is prefer by consum who can afford it has led to a rais of standard by some local processor incom influenc the market for standard as peopl becom richer they demand higher standard in countri where supermarket have made inroad into the domest market they introduc a varieti of standard both safeti eg qualiti test of milk use of packag and technic eg label type of cut livestock product have been less affect than veget but the share of milk pass through supermarket is increas rapid eg in china produc group may attempt to use sps measur to prevent dump although under wto this cannot be done pure as a trade barrier but onli where local standard justifi it tourism and media impact tourism creat a direct relationship between the consum of one countri and the who and what drive standard set 7 produc and processor of anoth it may creat a demand for certain product and safeti standard perhap result in a special market nich or eventu influenc the prefer of consum from the host countri it may also creat a hazard if tourist travel in livestock produc area and then return home consum prefer is affect by the inform at their dispos henc there is concern among middl class consum in africa about genet modifi organ which have receiv consider media exposur but rather less about zoonos which have an immedi and major impact on human health standard set process intern standard set which set the framework for negoti power in the intern arena requir an understand of the negoti process and the abil to particip there is a lack of represent of develop countri in sps meet and also in codex and this may be lead to an unnecessari trend toward rais of intern standard which should be those necessari for safe food consumpt rather than zero toler in addit to standard set negoti are need for intern trade where a countri has a strong produc organ eg the dairi industri in south africa the pig industri in chile it may be abl to negoti commerci agreement but still need the govern to particip in intern fora the privat sector is have an import impact for exampl prior to poland access to the european union eu foreign investor in poland set standard abov nation legisl nation legisl has now been upgrad to compli with eu regul the high standard are set particular by compani that are aim to export or intern retail chain like mcdonald with a global imag and sale to maintain is the privat sector keep pace with the dynam of the livestock sector or is it drive the dynam it seem that the percept held by retail of the need of consum when coupl with competit creat the dynam public sector involv often seem to lag behind the privat sector or even be driven by the privat sector for exampl in thailand the privat sector forc the govern to ban the import of certain chemic whilst the intern standard set process is relat slow the rate of chang in scientif knowledg the develop of new technolog consum demand and risk analysi progress at an everincreas rate problem for develop countri and the poor countri may face the follow problem that prevent them from fulli particip in the intern standard set process lack of resourc and particip of 200250 countri in the world n data approxim 150 are member of wto and 170 member of oie and codex those that do belong to intern bodi may be unabl to attend meet or to make the necessari invest to compli with standard due to lack of financ they may also lack motiv the import may not be understood or the countri may not be interest in export 8 n expert consult lack of expertis to understand the code to attend the meet it is easier for countri that trade in bloc sinc not all member of the bloc need to send repres to all meet limit access to scientif and technic inform for an offici to make an impact at an intern meet they need to be veri thorough brief beforehand countri that do not particip in discuss and negoti befor major meet will lack negoti power at meet output of intern meet are driven by inform from develop countri eg on mrl level stricter and stricter standard are driven by develop countri altern measur suitabl for the develop countri have not been explor econom or environment evalu are not carri out as a matter of routin befor standard are introduc or chang instead they are left to individu countri to implement there can be conflict between nation and intern standard standard can be complex and difficult to interpret standard may chang annual intern standard are publish in few languag to be interpret and use correct they need to be avail in the offici languag of each countri it can be difficult to make an accur translat of a complex scientif issu develop countri lack legal recours which is expens the veri poor tend to oper in inform market chang standard make it increas difficult for them to move into formal market those particip in formal market individu and on a small scale may be squeez out if regul chang or are enforc more strict for exampl the brazilian dairi sector has develop rapid and chang in the structur of food chain have result in consider fewer produc suppli major marketsth speed of chang may be as import as it direct for player in the food chain particular small produc and processor becaus of the invest requir in physic capit and human resourc for exampl in latin america china and poland supermarket penetr has been veri swift and has place demand on those wish to particip in associ valu chain factor that are alreadi influenc develop in standard and will be a potenti problem to the develop countri includ but are not restrict to the follow demand for greater

for mani develop countri with a strong focus on suppli stapl food from within the countri food secur can sometim be increas and food product made more effici by intern food chain but this requir polit secur to allow equit distribut to occur percept of what constitut food secur will be affect by percept of continu stabil in the food chain food safeti is consid veri import in develop countri but elsewher has receiv less attent for exampl anim health which is strong link to food secur has been emphas abov veterinari public health and data on the incid and impact of zoonot and foodborn diseas in human is veri limit food safeti need to be given increas but appropri emphasi as it is import to the poor a balanc is need between food safeti and the cost of food safeti the poor cannot afford to be sick and have limit social network to support them but equal should not be ask to pay for inappropri level of safeti it is not alway evid that risk is taken into account in assess appropri standard to be appli in a particular food chain the poor need food safeti but they may not need sps agreement and all that is contain in them govern should be set the minimum nation level of risk howev the intern communiti may be requir to do the appropri risk assess the govern should then decid to implement appropri measur which may includ standard enforc of exist standard or other measur there are differ between commod for exampl there is littl trade in milk between or from develop countri east africa is an except yet there is an increas nation demand for milk and milk product in urban centr suppli from peri urban and rural area through collect or vertic integr chain in africa there has been region trade in live anim for a long time involv most anim health standard but recent there has been an increas trade in chill carcass which requir food safeti standard poultri market tend to be segment exot bird produc in larg unit with intern set health and safeti standard suppli the export market and urban consum influenc by intern tast while local bird produc on small farm suppli local demand through a short valu chain with local determin standard 10 n expert consult trend in the structur of the food chain and their relationship with sps standard lengthen of food chain there has been a decoupl of product locat from consumpt and this has result in the risk through the food chain becom an issu it is possibl that environment concern will interrupt the trend toward lengthen the suppli chain though this is not yet evid the increas length of the food chain affect area such as the cost of transport the primari price is negoti and local produc may be pricetak becaus they have no transport and therefor no negoti power howev where a profession and commerci vertic oper chain is in place good price may be paid for qualiti of product when condit becom suffici attract a suffici number of consum and concentr of produc econom and polit stabil and therefor a predict level of profit the privat sector invest the length of food chain particular where they includ an intern dimens or cater to affluent local consum impact on consum and increas the requir for food safeti measur such as traceabl intern trade includ region trade between develop countri and here the standard appli may be veri differ from those for trade between develop and develop countri for privat sector intern involv there need to be at least a clear minimum standard to work to oie and codex standard should be the minimum need for safe oper of long food chain the consult is concern that these standard are in fact move to becom more repres of more affluent countri produc and consum which may creat obstacl to region trade vertic integr within food chain multination of food chain and a dramat rise in the market share of supermarket and the modern retail sector in mani countri have creat a number of effect such as import chang in procur system eg central a shift toward crossbord system with corpor procur in their differ countri of oper a shift toward specializedded wholesal special in product categori dedic to supermarket a shift toward prefer supplier system to select produc meet qualiti and safeti standard and lower transact cost a consolid of product and process which may be of unknown safeti a shift toward privat safeti and qualiti standard while the speed and intens of effect vari by region rapid in eastern europ latin america and china much slower in africa they suggest a trend that will continu market concentr within the food chain this can be driven by the follow a the need for greater effici for exampl with develop effort to concentr dairi produc into market group how will this affect the way standard are appli in dairi cooper in east africa milk is cool and much of it is sold fresh if the milk is to be use to produc ultra high temperatur uht milk it need to be of high qualiti b a respons to crisi eg in thailand follow the high pathogen avian influenza hpai crisi the poultri sector and particular the layer industri show sign of becom more concentr factor affect this includ produc liquid govern how do exist and anticip standard affect the structur of the livestock food chain and vice versa 11 ment polici and consum risk percept toward food safeti the trend was alreadi in evid as a result of the exportori polici of one larg compani but has been hasten by the diseas epidem region diversif and valu ad this introduc new product and therefor the need for new standard uganda tanzania and kenya have a region trade in fresh milk uht milk and valu

overcom these barrier chang in the valu chain may result in job creation eg process qualiti control produc or consum may experi posit extern for exampl vaccin of livestock own by poor farmer has in some case been subsidis by richer one excess thai chicken part from the export market with high safeti standard are sold to domest consum consum who can afford safe food should experi benefit in health when produc enter the formal market and encount tax they will hope to see tax be reinvest in the livestock sector howev there is limit evid of earmark taxat be use in this way loser countri or individu that are unabl to particip in the lobbi process may find that standard set are inappropri to the risk involv and disadvantag to them lobbi is a hidden but import cost for countri attempt to enter an export market negoti with prospect trade partner on certif and condit for export may also be 14 n expert consult an import cost countri or individu that cannot afford to meet complianc requir or cost especi for infrastructur requir will find that certain market are unavail to them complianc may requir capit invest knowledg and financ to chang manag practic as well as certif or assur when intern standard are abov minimum requir standard for food safeti they will creat a barrier to trade it could be argu that current bse regul are disproportion to risk the develop countri consum may lose if standard are not appropri form by scienc in view of the trend to intensif and consolid safeti of such consolid is not known for mani food chain there may be a need to make invest or manag chang veri quick therefor although long term benefit may be attract cash flow or lack of knowledg may make it imposs for peopl to take advantag higher valu market not onli requir greater invest in standard complianc but may also carri a higher risk of lose the market eg as a result of a diseas outbreak this may affect not onli those who are in the chain but also those who are outsid it produc a similar product for a differ market the intensif and consolid within the countri of suppli may compromis local and domest access to product produc for export and actual creat hardship in poor popul when a vertic integr market develop there are three cluster of produc those who are alreadi competit those that can be help to make it and those who will never make it who will either remain in the inform market or need other sourc of incom in some countri the transform take mani year in other it happen veri quick in malaysia and thailand as market chain for pig and poultri have becom more export orient and vertic integr and standard have been more strict impos the number of smallhold particip has becom much smaller 15 what can be done to help the loser in particular what can be done to assist the poor to cope standard set priorit of appropri food safeti standard anim health appear to be a higher prioriti than food safeti for mani nation govern except where consum have consider voic this consult has conclud that food safeti is link to food secur is benefici to the poor when it is provid at an appropri level and deserv a higher prioriti on nation agenda intern agenc can assist but nation govern ultim determin their own prioriti equalis access to the standard set process effort have been made to encourag the poorest countri to attend intern meet and to understand and appli sps measur as yet they have insuffici access to the negoti process that preced meet and may be inadequ brief contribut factor to particip includ membership in intern standard set bodi membership in trade bloc provid economi of scale in manag knowledg about standard willing of more affluent countri to involv poorer countri in the full negoti process as well as support from the intern communiti eg incountri workshop in sps to help countri identifi their issu assist to attend meet poor produc and poor consum are unlik to have much voic in the standard set process until they particip fulli in the formal market becom organis and join lobbi group set appropri standard it is necessari to promot standard that are appropri for the risk manag situat and can actual be enforc risk manag measur to creat food safeti includ standard vari with food chain and situat intern vertic chain depend on sps standard and agreement between trade partner nation vertic chain have minimum standard set by govern but consum privat processor and retail may set addit standard one exampl of this is in the thai milk market where the highest qualiti standard are now set by retail condens milk use to be common drunk by the poor now there is more fresh 16 n expert consult milk drunk which has a nutrit benefit inde in the thai poultri and pig market nation standard and abattoir for domest market are run under inadequ legisl although those for export run under a much higher level of legisl competit can drive up standard eg import chees in south africa is set qualiti standard that some local produc and processor are tri to match in inform market standard are agre between produc and consum for own consumpt the producerconsum decid what standard to appli at this level legisl may alreadi be suffici but dissemin the messag is equal import enforc is great influenc by respons this requir both defin the scope of account and promot the mindset to accept it risk communic to develop countri and within develop countri is an import compon of this processtranspar and inform access to produc and consum need to be improv and this requir capac build in risk communic assist in compli with standard access to inform understand of the sps agreement and it implic and up to date brief are essenti for nation govern to fulli particip in oie and codex decis make there is a need to make more effort in help all member countri of these organ to access the sps inform system inform about sps process should ideal be distil and present accord to differ need eg for differ commod differ level of particip in intern trade and the possibl implic of propos chang specif solut could come from consult with member countri tool to support decis make it is import that all govern use standard set as part of a risk manag system by ask question like to what standard do they wish to protect consum and cost do they have a tourist industri do they wish to exporttrad how import is the export market what standard for export will it be econom viabl to introduc heighten standard are they prepar for variabl standard what food safeti problem will need to be address what anim diseas need to be tackl are their current standard appropri can they meet oblig how can they demonstr they have met the oblig who will negoti on their behalf decis support tool are need to assist polici maker in determin what is appropri for their nation market what may be unfair disadvantag them what chang may be need in nation legisl and support servic to make what can be done to help the loser in particular what can be done to assist the poor to cope 17 it possibl for particip in livestock valu chain to compli with chang in standard a number of tool and guidelin exist and some have been prepar by n but there is a lack of work exampl and concret case studi as well as a confus plethora of inform in addit mandat intern organ should provid their own assess of the impact of chang standard on the poorest who are least equip to do the analysi for themselv there is a need to assess econom as well as technic risk of chang in market and standard includ an assess of extern eg who will be affect if the market fail through an uncontrol risk adequ surveil of foodborn diseas is lack in the poorest set and this surveil function is critic in evalu the success of system invest in health infrastructur in poor set is key to creat this capac support to small produc and processor to encourag good practic good practic guidelin for practition are in exist but not for all commod and product system these need to be updat and more wide dissemin assist small farmer trader and processor to enter formal regul or vertic integr market will includ but not be restrict to help them to compli with standard it may involv quit wide rang chang to manag practic involv of a wide rang of player greater input of good scienc into risk assess evalu and communic is need eg precaut against bses are veri hard to justifi econom univers and other research institut have an import role to play involv of the privat sector can produc benefici chang eg nestl model for involv smallhold in the dairi valu chain in pakistan and china this busi model requir polit stabil a suffici larg and concentr consum popul that can afford to purchas process milk a suffici popul of livestock produc to provid the necessari volum of produc and suffici infrastructur where these condit do not exist signific privat sector involv is unlik sinc the risk will be too high or the return too low exit strategi those who cannot particip in the formal market may need to exit from livestock product or find an addit incom sourc polici chang must therefor embrac more than agricultur addit it must be about creat condit to encourag invest eg educ inform credit the abil of farmer to adjust in order to particip in the formal market will be affect by equiti eg land hold which affect the abil to particip in a valu chain the sever of the effect will depend part on the speed of chang eg in brazil major milk compani hold 50 of the formal market in three year exclud approxim 35 of their produc the best approach will be countri specif and will requir empower of displac 18 n expert consult market chain member so that they are abl to adopt altern livelihood option for exampl befor the hpai outbreak in thailand small scale produc use to depend on contract farm now there is a possibl that larg produc will choos to contain the whole valu chain within one busi without contract farm and small farmer will go out of busi govern is encourag them to invest in evapor hous but this will not be econom for mani and some will go out of commerci chicken farm empow would need to includ extens on biosecur poultri rais inform and train in other option as well as credit to start other livelihood activ african farmer are awar that their children may not have a secur futur in farm lead mani to choos educ as a safeti net so that their children have a choic of livelihood in this situat a veri broad base polici process encompass sector other than agricultur is need to mitig the impact of chang in the livestock sector 19 recommend n mandat and activ ns mandat is to rais level of nutrit improv agricultur product better the live of rural popul and contribut to the growth of the world economi http wwwnorgunnaboutmandateenhtml the consult conclud that set and enforc of sps standard at intern and nation level has a major impact in each of these area and that n has an import role to play it strength lie in interdisciplinari capabl in econom and social scienc as well as biolog scienc the follow are specif recommend challeng for the futur the pace of chang is increas in all area of anim health human health and food safeti standard and this impact on poor popul histor veri rapid chang in this area has been harm to poor produc n should encourag a nation agenda of gradual implement to avoid serious advers impact on the most vulner produc and consum in order to do this it will be necessari to monitor the impact of chang standard on vulner group learn lesson and bring them to the attent of govern where similar situat aris intens and extens farm system embodi differ risk and may requir differ approach n need to be awar of propos from the standard set bodi to review their impact and possibl interact and consid them in an holist manner intern standard are gold standard but not necessarili achiev quick or even appropri for domest or region food chain eg laboratori test standard maximum residu level diseas control uniform gold standard are not global enforc equival option to manag the risk should be defin both for and by develop countri eg between pasteur and boil milk powder or uht bse surveil they must be applic enforc and practic n should evalu intern sps standard in the context of their impact on develop countri the standard set process effort should be made to identifi the gap in the scienc that impact on the standard set process eg diseas of trade ai zoonot diseas mrls and provid inform to the bodi and member countri involv in standard set this is a respons of the whole intern communiti it will requir a coordin agenda with broad interdisciplinari research to provid the scientif inform necessari to ensur the develop of appropri evid base standard n should work with other intern organ and the privat sector in order to obtain the inform that is need the doha declar expect that lic should becom wto member the consulta 20 n expert consult tion recognis that there has been a major input from the intern organ to encourag particip and provid train and advic on implement of sps standard one further step in this process is to analys the involv of develop countri to the standard set process and the reason whi they do not attend or contribut it is suggest that n should undertak this as a regular process and explor altern and innov method that do not necessarili involv attend central meet and put in place a mechan for measur the success of this programm oie and codex have the mandat to develop standard there is no intern organ current monitor evalu or communic the impact of standard on sustain develop this ideal occur befor and dure the process of standard develop and remain an import function dure the implement of standard it fall within ns mandat to take on this role and n should take a lead in this process it is import that the public of an econom social and environment impact statement is prepar when new standard are set or major revis of exist standard take place methodolog standard set within a risk manag context is a multidisciplinari activ programm manag or task forc have been use by member countri to bring togeth the rang of expertis necessari without major organiz chang n has a number of separ initi these need to be synerg and harmonis in a programm rather than a silo structur n should develop a framework for decis make includ criteria to enabl develop countri to assess their requir in a systemat manner a consist applic of a standard framework is essenti and should includ assess manag and communic of risk it should includ an econom evalu a food chain approach is a use way to identifi gap in food safeti a valu chain approach is use to identifi distribut and govern issu both are recognis and have been use by n howev the consult recommend a more systemat and uniform approach to their use and suggest that as a start point an attempt is made to typifi livestock valu chain n should continu to provid advic to countri as request use the framework for risk analysi and the decis process previous describ but tailor to the need of develop countri the overal approach to food safeti and veterinari public health this consult believ that the issu of food safeti is central to the poor food safeti cannot be uncoupl from food secur especi for the poor and vulner it is recognis that chang in standard have a complex effect on low incom countri and the poor while the sps standard can be valuabl in promot food safeti the process by which they are set and the speed at which they are implement may at the same time result in exclus of vulner group from particip in the food chain n should use it offic to develop appropri strategi for analysi of the problem and promot reccomend 21 effect method of deal with it figur to assess the problem are not clear known there appear to be over emphasi on problem of the wealthi countri eg residu level rather than basic safe food n should work with who to assess the problem becaus they have complementari skill share inform is import there is also a lack of primari data but it may be valuabl to explor new analys of exist but unexploit data advocaci on behalf of develop countri the consult recognis that there is excel technic cooper on a region basi and that there is an n repres in the major of member countri it is import to build on this structur to maxim the way in which n relat to the member countri at the high level and use this to inform the standard set process n is in a posit to champion and protect the interest of least develop member state and work with region group of standard set organ to take into account issu of relev to the lidc this consult see this advocaci as a common good for develop of all n member there is a need to promot risk analysi methodolog and it applic in the develop

as improv econom return from these fisheri the main issu should not be what fisheri are set out to achiev but whether these object can be met with avail technic and logist resourc achiev optim sustain econom return from a fisheri is far from simpl main due to the lack of the necessari inform to defin where the optimum is and how to get there to defin the optimum and then enforc the condit to ensur this is reach requir consider scientif and manag expertis and resourc howev onc set up monitor and maintain the fisheri should be simpl and well within the capabl of most govern good manag requir polit choic which is whi emphasi is place here on easier communic by reduc complex fisheri to a set of simpler perform indic and plan ahead plan ahead mean gain agreement on appropri action befor they need to be appli prior agreement not onli allow govern to plan ahead but industri too this should lead to smoother chang and greater stabil in the long term this manual is focus on caribbean queen conch strombus giga and the requir for respons manag of the fisheri exploit this import resourc with particular emphasi on the requir to compli with cite regul and requir for the appendix ii list it present guidelin onli the larg differ between fisheri make it imposs to prescrib exact what must be done in all fisheri howev it is possibl to make two general requir that will need to be met by ani conch fisheri the process and catch capac need to be on the same scale as the product of the resourc where there is overcapac polit and econom pressur will often lead to shortterm plan aim at meet immedi demand of the process and catch capac which in turn will lead to overfish a stock assess should provid advic on the appropri capac it should be possibl to show that the polici and the fisheri manag system are effect for this you have to monitor the resourc state and the fisheri when a control is appli you need to be abl to demonstr that the control affect the monitor variabl in the manner expect for exampl if the averag vessel catch rate is use to monitor stock size when you appli a control such as reduc the number of vessel allow fish so as to increas stock size you need to see a correspond increas in catch rate this impli that the control has increas the stock as intend similar it should be possibl to show that a stock increas onc a notak zone has been establish there are mani reason whi control may be ineffect if you do not have effect control you are not manag the fisheri and not meet cite requir the level of manag control and monitor need to be appropri for the size of the fisheri there is often concern that the manag requir will be too expens it need not be and should not be expens relat to the size of the fisheri import the more certain 1 you wish to be as to the state of the fisheri and you will need to be certain if you wish to exploit the resourc at close to the maximum level the better inform and enforc will be requir and the higher the cost of manag lower manag cost general mean lower level of exploit but should not prevent you from exploit the resourc effici and optim there are two way to deal with uncertainti the first and perhap most import is to obtain more and better inform about your fisheri the second is to keep fish pressur low this decreas the chanc of overfish even if you are uncertain exact when overfish will occur it is quit possibl where a manag regim is not well develop that you will start with littl inform on which to base decis it is reason to develop a programm which will bring the manag system up to the requir standard without close the fisheri to meet intern standard howev the develop would need to follow a predetermin time tabl section 2 to 6 part 1 cover the main issu and exampl in a relat nontechn manner this part is suitabl for decisionmak and person not familiar with fisheri method section 7 to 16 part 2 cover similar issu in a more technic manner further inform on fisheri manag in general can be obtain from the public list at the end of this manual these includ the n technic guidelin for respons fisheri no 4 fisheri manag n 1997 the n technic guidelin for respons fisheri no 42 fisheri

convent for intern trade in endang speci of wild fauna and flora cite and the n code of conduct for respons fisheri ccrf the convent for the intern trade in endang speci cite is an agreement to control the export and import of speci list in it appendic most import such as the european union and unit state of america are bound by the agreement conch is list under appendix ii the most relev part of the convent for conch is 2 the export of ani specimen of a speci includ in appendix ii shall requir the prior grant and present of an export permit an export permit shall onli be grant when the follow condit have been met a a scientif author of the state of export has advis that such export will not be detriment to the surviv of that speci and 3 appendix ii speci export should be limit in order to maintain that speci throughout it rang at a level consist with it role in the ecosystem in which it occur and well abov the level at which that speci might becom elig for inclus in appendix i appendix i list speci are ban from intern trade if conch were list under appendix i the export trade in conch would essenti ceas the central aim of fisheri manag is to prevent overfish the n code of conduct set out the principl which need to be appli to achiev this we can reinterpret cite convent in the term of the code of conduct while the code cover consider more issu than cite cite requir fall well within it scope in fact perhap the most import aim of good fisheri manag is to maintain the abund of the stock abov the state where it would be consid deplet or have a negat impact on the ecosystem this should be as a minimum abov the endang state where the speci would be move from appendix ii to appendix i ideal good manag of queen conch fisheri across the region and in accord with the code of conduct should result in the restor of the stock to a state where queen conch no longer meet the criteria for list on appendix ii and could be delist so if we appli good manag as defin under the code of conduct cite condit are met the product of the resourc is maintain and it function in the ecosystem is not impair howev we still need to defin overfish and overfish the decis to decid that a fisheri is overfish need to be base on more than expert opinion it need to have a sound basi in scienc which depend on data collect and research it is also critic that a fisheri can be clear seen to be not overfish by peopl not involv in the fisheri 3 2 fisheri biolog fish stock have much in common with other exploit live resourc such as goat manag fisheri is like manag a goat herd where you must maintain the herd with it own offspr if you sell too mani femal goats1 you will not be abl to produc enough young goat in futur year to support the herd product and eventu you will have to reduc the number sold convers if you allow the goat popul to increas they will consum all the avail grass and forag and will becom thinner produc fewer kid and will be more like to die from diseas until the herd balanc out with birth and death reach it carri capac usual farmer like to maintain the herd at it optimum size the size when it product is at it maximum the maximum sustain yield if you replac goat with conch you have a descript of conch fisheri manag howev there are two import differ between farm and fish you will be uncertain exact how mani conch remain in the sea wherea a farmer can count his stock you can onli make an estim of how mani conch you have remain to ensur the stock can replenish it to ensur the estim is as good as possibl and to make it accept to all parti includ cite you must use good statist and scientif method the stock is held in common with all fishers2 where as sole owner a farmer can take decis in his own best longterm interest fisher can not unless they cooper if fisher believ that ani conch they leav will be taken by other from their point of view there is no benefit in leav enough conch in the sea to replenish the stock under such condit they are therefor encourag to take as much as they can befor the stock is deplet by other it is manag task to creat the circumst where it is in fisher best longterm interest to cooper this will requir set up a suitabl system of access right effort control or both as well as an effect manag system a part of that manag system must be to ensur the regul are obey becaus illeg fish poach may not onli direct caus overfish but may also undermin the degre to which fisher will cooper with manag 3 the fisheri manag cycl fisheri manag like drive a car should be a feedback control system drive a car consist of the control acceler brake gear and steer wheel and monitor the driver eye and ear when you are drive you are constant monitor the progress and posit of your car and take appropri action by slow down speed up or chang the direct in which the car is move few peopl drive without move the steer wheel or with their eye shut fisheri manag also need control in the case of queen conch fisheri control are usual in the form of effort limit catch quota minimum size and close area and eye and ear in the form of a monitor programm the monitor programm should do more than simpli report on the state of the

unnecessari risk and irrevers action and support research and data collect which will reduc uncertainti 32 control legisl should allow the mean to control the exploit rate of the resourc and various other protect measur which reduc the chanc of overfish it is best to use a varieti of control and not just depend upon one control should alway includ some limit on fish effort or at the veri least a limit on fish capac fish effort is the work done by fisher to catch fish day fish amount of gear set etc fish capac is the maximum limit on what effort work could be appli in the shortterm in a particular fisheri for exampl capac could be the number of vessel avail for fish the limit on effort ie capac would be reach if all these vessel fish all the time that they possibl could effort control might forc day fish to be reduc below this limit vessel could be laid up for exampl or limit in how mani day of the week they are allow to fish howev the capit cost of the vessel eg interest on loan use to purchas the vessel strong encourag their maximum use therefor tri to maintain effort far below the potenti fish capac becom veri difficult to enforc and repres a signific cost to both industri and manag 33 data collect data will be need to monitor the fisheri data must be collect for object assess of the state of the fisheri and is necessari for ration inform decisionmak an effici

the data collect system to the fish industri practic for exampl it is natur for processor to provid purchas receipt to fisher and routin data collect can includ get copi of such receipt get copi of such transact need not be oner to industri and accuraci is enforc by the busi involv there are four type of monitor data which can be collect in order of import fisheri base indic will monitor the input to and output from the fisheri indic usual includ catch and fish effort abund base indic will monitor the chang in the popul size a common use index is catchperuniteffort but some fisheri are monitor use abund survey biolog indic monitor specif aspect of the fish popul an import statist is the number or weight of femal in the popul at spawn time as in mani speci one male should be abl to fertil the egg of mani femal the abil of the popul to replenish itself is usual thought to depend on the number of femal howev this also depend on the speci and in the case of queen conch scientist may decid to assum an equal sex ratio between male and femal is desir socioeconom and other indic are import to monitor the fisheri in relat to polici requir to meet econom object the simplest indic would be the price of the product which multipli by the land give the revenu from the fisheri other indic of interest could includ the number of employe licens fisher and number involv in process etc and cost of the industri 34 data analysi raw data need to be interpret use model of the fisheri model are just simpl version of how scientist think the fisheri behav and should captur the most import behaviour of the fisheri in relat to manag decis becaus model are onli approxim of realiti the advic obtain from them need care consider the analysi should produc simpl indic which indic how well the fisheri is do appropri indic includ averag vessel catch rate fish mortal and the spawn stock biomass these can be use to indic the econom effici of the fisheri whether the fisheri is sustain and whether the stock is overfish 35 decisionmak the decisionmak author need to be defin that is the peopl respons for the decis need to be clear identifi decis need to be document and transpar so that it is clear how and whi particular decis have been made decisionmak must be consist with cite and the code of conduct the easiest way to implement these polici is to appli decis rule decis rule are manag action which are plan to be appli in respons to key chang in indic for exampl a simpl decis rule could be a 20 percent reduct in quota when catch rate fall below some critic level the differ between decis rule and ani other sort of decisionmak is that the rule are 6 plan in advanc they should be simpl and transpar so that their implic to the fish industri can be discuss befor they have to be appli 36 enforc and complianc while decis can be made easili ensur they are carri out can be difficult enforc usual consist of direct method and audit method direct method includ patrol by enforc vessel and spot check at land point by fisheri offic these method can be expens but at least some direct polic at land site is recommend a complementari method creat audit trail by use document and compar inform obtain at differ point dure the catch to export process this is a power method to enforc rule and regul set by decisionmak and auditlik document is increas requir for intern export by mani countri and intern organis like cite enforc unpopular decis can be expens or imposs improv the effect of decisionmak requir two action a consult with stakehold and particip in decisionmak make decis better as the concern of stakehold are taken into account also if stakehold understand the problem they may be more readi to accept decis that result in shortterm hardship in exchang for longterm sustain benefit comanag is a term impli fisher and other particip in manag and encourag much of the decisionmak to be devolv to the fisher themselv b enforc is alway necessari onc a few fisher get away with ignor control other lawabid fisher will see less reason for themselv to follow regul and control and manag can break down similar poach undermin the manag process unless it can be suppress by enforc activ cite has prove use in help countri enforc decis howev this is a twoway process and in return manag have to accept interfer in polici by stakehold and the requir for transpar in decisionmak one complaint against cite has been the lack of involv of stakehold in make cite polici cite is perceiv by some as have been thrust upon mani caribbean countri which may make enforc in some case more difficult 37 feedback and review it is import that decisionmak undergo some sort of feedback wherebi the process can make improv adapt to new situat and learn from it mistak feedback should not be obtain onli from the manag author govern offici and the like but should includ industri and other stakehold react to their concern and includ them in the manag process should improv manag make it more cost effect and better enforc independ review particular of the technic part of the decisionmak process ie the scienc will add signific to the credibl of the decis it is rare possibl for intern institut to studi a fisheri manag system in depth confid in the manag system can come from independ expert who do have the time and local knowledg to studi decis and satisfi themselv perhap through discuss with decis 7 maker that the process has met intern standard local independ scientist for exampl might be easili recruit from the region academ institut 4 exampl manag system the follow general exampl follow implement of some of the idea in the manual in two fisheri these exampl have been simplifi to illustr the approach the realiti of daytoday manag need to consid mani detail of administr not cover here one of the aim of these exampl is to demonstr that good manag need not be expens or complex fair simpl procedur may be appli and provid adequ manag for small scale fisheri as long as they are well adapt to local condit 41 turk and caico island 411 background most fish occur on the caico bank a 6 140 km2 area of shallow sand seagrass alga and reef habitat suitabl for conch there are approxim 600 regist fisher and 200 vessel exploit conch land around 450 pound whole meat each fish day vessel are three metr in length and have outboard engin they depart in the morn and return mid to late afternoon usual land at one of the five main process plant that purchas the conch shell are remov and discard at sea conch are clean frozen and pack for export main to the unit state recent quota for the total land meat weight were 1 675 million pound fall to 14 million pound becaus of concern over the state of the stock 42 polici the polici is bound by cite requir and the stock is manag so as not to impair the abil of the conch popul to replenish itself this in practic mean maintain the popul abov 50 percent of it unexploit size when the popul is at 50 percent of it unexploit size it is presum to be at the point of maximum sustain yield onc below this point the stock is consid overfish 43 control the fisheri is primarili control through licens and an export quota which is calcul base on a target tac4 there is also a small area close to fish a close season to spread the catch more even through the year and fisher are not allow to use breath apparatus but must free dive the export tac was set up larg as a result of cite requir the export tac is control both local and intern through custom most export go through miami usa where they must be accompani by a cite form issu by the turk and caico govern which indic the part of the tac which the export constitut quota as part of the tac are alloc to processor 4 tac total allow catch 8 the number of licenc is limit but is not control by manag while ani turk island can get a licenc the number of elig peopl in the popul is small make the number of fulltim licenc fisher limit the process sector is similar licens although they do not onli process conch they also buy lobster and finfish from fisher 44 data collect data collect for monitor purpos reli main on the process industri everi processor must complet form indic the daili land from each vessel at the end of each month the processor send the complet form to the fisheri depart where the data are enter on to a comput the data report by industri are use to calcul the total land catch by ad up all the report daili land and the total effort by count all the land that have been made each land report for a boat repres a day fish for a boat the fish effort the turk and caico island is uniqu in that it has a veri long time seri of data which can be use to help interpret how the resourc respond to differ level of fish 45 data analysi a standard fisheri model is use to interpret the catch and effort data by analys past behaviour of the fisheri it is possibl to estim the abund of conch relat to the unexploit stock size and estim the current product of the stock it is necessari to know both to set an appropri quota 46 decisionmak ultim author and therefor decis rest with the minist for fisheri howev the minist take advic from a scientif committe and decis go against this advic would have to be justifi the scientif committe assess evid base on a stock assess the stock assess main assess the impact of manag action on the catch rate of fisher set a reduc tac should lead to an increas in queen conch and therefor an increas in the averag catch taken on a vessel fish day convers higher tac will decreas the abund of conch and therefor the catch taken on a day fish the limit refer point the level that manag aim to maintain the catch rate abov is around 450 pound per day as this is estim to be the maximum sustain yield point in addit the scientif committe need to appli the precautionari approach so higher catch rate are prefer 47 enforc and complianc although the tac is set base on land the land are control through export quota alloc to each processor and not enforc direct the yield from process is 40 percent of the tac onc the export quota are met by processor the fisheri is close and no further land undertaken stockpil conch for the follow season was a problem but has been discourag and is not permit other control are enforc direct by fisheri depart patrol in particular poach vessel from other state have been caught and prosecut howev the inform requir to catch 9 such poacher has usual been base on inform from fisher or polic surveil regular fisheri patrol have prove difficult and cost to maintain 48 feedback and review there is no formal review process for the assess howev the scientif committe is made up of local expert as well as govern scientist so that the advic is independ local scientist also take part in region fisheri workshop where inform review can also take place 5 51 jamaica background the jamaica conch fisheri oper main on the pedro bank south of jamaica legal land have recent been in the region of 1 500 metric tonn vessel are larg mother boat each have sever catch vessel the mother vessel work on the pedro bank for trip of sever week conch is partial process and frozen at sea diver use both scuba and hookah gear due to the water depth 52 polici the aim has been to move the fisheri from unsustain to sustain exploit in earli year of the fisheri land were veri high and uncontrol rather than chang the quota immedi to the lower long term level a stepwis quota reduct was agre with industri to give them time to adjust their capac and fish activ the second main concern has been to look at way to reduc poach illeg fish is seen as a signific problem all illeg catch are remov from the total quota which is base on the biolog product of the stock befor the remaind can be alloc to the legal fisheri clear there is a direct signific advantag to the legal fisheri in reduc illeg fish 53 control the fisheri is primarili control through licens and an export quota the export quota is set by the govern depart fisher are allow to use breath apparatus as the exploit area is in relat deep water the number of licenc issu and the vessel quota alloc is agre with the processor who own the vessel there is a close season for conch 1 30 octob when all catch and trade in conch is prohibit includ import control over the quota has been help by the monitor which is necessari for the sanitari standard requir for export to europ and the unit state hazard analysi critic control point combin monitor system has help implement the conch quota effici licenc alloc is condit upon meet various requir these are clear print on the back of the licenc the condit are design to make monitor and enforc much easier ad them explicit to the issu licenc document ensur fisher are fulli awar of their oblig 10 the main concern has been with poach while direct enforc through patrol vessel for exampl has not been undertaken due to high cost jamaica has been abl to use the control through trade ie cite to appli pressur to reduc illeg fish 54 data collect the stock has been monitor primarili through biomass survey these survey have been conduct by diver swim fix distanc over the pedro bank count and measur conch by conduct a larg number of such transect the total biomass of conch can be estim there has been a lack of support of the conch data collect programm by vessel oper this has prevent develop a catch and effort base programm as use in the turk and caico island industri has made a signific financi contribut to the conch survey howev 55 data analysi the survey data has been use in three way a the biomass can be monitor direct decreas in quota or illeg fish should produc higher estim of biomass convers increas in quota should decreas the biomass b a model has been appli to interpret the survey data and estim the maximum sustain yield this set the maximum quota that could be alloc appli the precautionari approach and allow for illeg fish has meant that the quota is set below this figur c anoth way to assess the state of the stock has been to compar two survey area one fish at the current averag rate and the other not fish becaus it is inaccess or protect the assumpt is that the area not fish have the same densiti of conch as the whole area would if unexploit this assumpt need care review but nevertheless such comparison can give general indic as to the state of the stock 56 decisionmak the quota has been arrang between govern and industri and is base on scientif advic ultim author rest with the minist for fisheri although decis have been made on the advic of the fisheri divis the quota is alloc to the differ part of industri through a committe industri take a signific role in manag decis which encourag industri to abid by them 57 feedback and review jamaica has a cite scientif committe respons for review cite issu in jamaica of which conch is one concern the committe made up of independ scientist and peopl from institut

consumpt through restaur should be abl to suppli total catch with high accuraci and effort for the major of the fisheri the noncommerci fisheri includ tradit subsist is more difficult to monitor and it would be advis to use method base on sampl 1022 commerci land monitor processor should report all the catch they purchas from fisher this inform should be maintain for their own financi record anyway the requir is onli to copi this inform to the manag author receipt should be obtain for all transact this is particular import if the fisheri is control through catch quota if quota are oper report catch will need to be verifi by inspect data should be kept as simpl as possibl given a vessel regist onli an identifi for the vessel is requir eg licenc number or captain name for daili trip onli the catch land on each day is requir if possibl the time of departur and return is use but not necessari the fish time are valuabl onli where there is signific variat in the number of hour in a trip in mani fisheri the trip time doe not vari much it is not reason to expect a commerci compani or cooper to suppli much more data than they record anyway as part of their normal oper clear the quantiti of catch purchas fall into this categori but much beyond this would requir anoth approach 1023 commerci logbook commerci vessel go out for more than one day perhap carri out process on board should be requir to complet logbook for larger vessel this is not particular oner as such vessel keep their own privat fish log logbook should record on each day the date locat and amount of fish some measur of effort depend on gear in this case hour fish multipli by the number of fisher and catch weight 1024 export commerci catch for export can be obtain from two main sourc actual export should be report to the govern custom depart as export requir cite certif by the scientif author it should be relat straightforward to measur all export land process weight need to be link to land through a statist model this requir good estim of the convers paramet base upon a larg sampl from the land 26 1025 commerci purchas receipt all local restaur purchas could be monitor through purchas receipt restaur should suppli copi each month to the manag author of purchas receipt with the date fisher ident and amount bought and valu of the conch receipt should be simpl to complet it may be necessari to carri out spot check on quantiti in storag to verifi receipt particular if such purchas cover a signific proport of the catch with growth in tourism restaur purchas may be one of the largest chang in local consumpt it is import to monitor chang in catch as these have a direct impact on the exploit level therefor if tourism is chang or fluctuat monitor tourist consumpt will be an import compon of the data collect system 1026 obtain noncommerci catch and effort stamatopoulo 2002 describ the samplebas fisheri survey method in detail this method is appropri to noncommerci conch fish where there is no easi way to institut or enforc fisher to keep record samplebas fisheri monitor requir three compon first a sampl frame is requir this usual consist of a complet enumer of all land site and the vessel which will land there uptod inform should avail through a vessel regist if no regist exist a frame survey will be requir everi few year until a regist is develop second fisheri staff must visit land site and measur the vessel activ site can be chosen at random if there are more site than staff avail if staff know how mani vessel could land at a site from the vessel regist they can check which of these vessel have left to fish and are expect back they need to visit as frequent as possibl in a month if visit must be limit they should be made at random time dure a month final vessel trip need to be sampl to obtain estim of mean catchperunit effort this will requir that staff choos vessel random when they land if staff cannot measur all vessel catch vessel must let them measur their land at this point size frequenc and other data may also be collect through a trip interview these data can be combin to estim total fish effort and total catch which can be ad to the commerci fisheri estim method also allow the statist uncertainti to be estim and includ in assess this make the approach potenti veri effici in collect inform cheapli 1027 consumpt interview data where a substanti subsist fisheri exist with no set land site consumpt survey may give some estim of the quantiti of catch taken this would sampl the local popul and ask how much and how often peopl eat conch given a total popul census it is possibl to rais this estim to obtain the amount of the total catch that was consum by local inhabit which will need to be ad into ani assess if not alreadi includ elsewher 27 103 catch size frequenc sampl catch can be sampl at land site possibl measur will depend on what is be land it is recommend that the follow are obtain through sampl land shell length and lip thick where the shell is land unprocess meat weight sex matur process meat weight for size catch frequenc a random sampl is requir for convers relationship a wide rang of weight is requir therefor not all measur are requir for all anim it is recommend that unprocess meat weight sex and matur be measur for a random sampl of land around 300 conch should be adequ in the first instanc of these a smaller select taken from the largest smallest and medium size individu can be weigh befor and after process the same process would appli to shell length lip thick unprocess meat weight matur and sex ani control would have to be consist so that fisher could avoid discard dead conch and instead appli select toward flare lip conch this may involv employ fisher to land shell to allow sampl there are no commerci size categori that can be use howev if a minimum weight limit is appli it is possibl anim below this limit will be sold local this may still achiev the conserv object if the price is reduc but would have to be monitor and assess 104 fisheri independ survey stock survey can give immedi estim of biomass and are particular recommend where no fisheri has previous exist howev they onli give an estim of current biomass may be expens and are not absolut necessari they are current use by jamaica to monitor biomass likewis fish experi may indic biomass in particular area and can also be use to estim fish mortal fish experi use intens fish in a monitor area effect close to immigr and emigr of conch to relat the declin in densiti to the catch coupl with a survey they would be particular use and provid rapid inform but again may be prohibit expens for some fisheri survey design is a specialist activ requir particular expertis howev the basic method will follow common design need see thompson 1992 it is necessari to have a map of the survey area on which the sampl design is base the map might be stratifi by habitat type the simplest strata might be by depth it is necessari to choos random locat across the sampl area within each stratum the number of transect should be chosen on the basi of the requir precis in general the more transect that are includ the more precis the estim will be ie the narrow the confid interv on the estim all transect must either have their length record or must be of equal length 28 transect can be conduct in two way the simplest is to appli an absolut width where the surveyor count all conch within a set distanc of the transect line and ignor all other the altern is to count all conch that are seen but measur their perpendicular distanc to the transect line this last allow a detect function to be estim where conch are common a fix width transect is probabl the best altern howev where they are rare a method base on perpendicular distanc may prove a better techniqu it would be possibl to mix the two method with separ method appli in differ strata for exampl although subsequ estim would be more difficult to obtain juvenil can be separ from matur by their flare lip finer divis base on size and how worn the shell is can be develop with train more effici design than random sampl may be use where conch are heavili aggreg cluster sampl and adapt cluster sampl allow sampl effort to focus where conch have been found this is a more sophist approach to sampl but under some circumst particular where densiti are low may be use 105 tag tag could form an import sourc of inform on conch mani of the problem associ with tag other speci do not occur with conch the tag is place on the shell so it is fast relat cheap and tag loss is neglig the main problem is ensur tag conch are return by fisher to the scientist conch can be tag by wire and number plastic disk the sex matur shell length weight flare lip thick are record these data with meat weight should be record again when the tag conch is return this allow growth and mortal to be estim where possibl tag should concentr on smaller younger conch the main problem is get fisher to return tag conch to the scientist even where fisher agre to cooper the tag will be overgrown by alga over time and therefor difficult to spot ensur fisher check for tag dure the experi would be import as tag can provid consider inform quick on the current state of the resourc and fisheri it is alway worth review whether a tag experi would be feasibl in each fisheri 106 other inform beyond research specif paramet biolog research can be carri out on life histori ecolog and habitat use this inform is valuabl in manag as well as for develop new improv model for assess such research is not a prioriti howev but should follow basic stock assess activ and implement of appropri fisheri control for most scientif author monitor the scientif literatur and attend appropri workshop and confer will be adequ to obtain and use this inform 29 11 assess link data to indic 111 introduct in order to assess ani fisheri an oper model of the fisheri is requir the aim is to estim the paramet for the model chosen the model paramet will then defin the appropri refer point for the indic various assess are possibl but two approach are highlight here 112 biomass dynam assess 1121 indic and refer point an assess of biomass should be abl to use all indic and estim of biomass includ survey and cpue the assess aim to construct a histori of biomass chang and the potenti and safe yield from the popul indic can be simpl eg cpue catch effort or base on model variabl eg biomass spawn stock biomass or fish mortal the former has the advantag that it is more easili understood by manag the key refer point are the biomass and fish mortal at maximum sustain yield msi if biomass fall below the biomass at msi a rebuild programm should be appli target refer point can be develop base on econom and fisher requir 12 extinct unexploit 1 product or yield 08 06 04 f01 02 msi 0 0 25 50 biomass unexploit 75 100 figur 3 the diagram illustr stock biomass growth describ by the logist form of a biomass dynam model the stock produc no surplus product that is it doe not chang it size when it is unexploit and when it is extinct popul is zero when unexploit the stock reach it carri capac for the environ and onli reproduc enough young to 30 replac those which die when the popul is reduc in size it will produc more biomass than is lost through natur caus so that the popul grow this excess product is shown on the yaxi of the curv product is zero at extinct and at the unexploit size but there is some maximum in between label as the maximum sustain yield msi and often use as a refer point maximum sustain yield is too riski for manag to aim for as it is right on the edg of overfish altern target refer point have been propos to reduc the chanc of overfish f01 illustr identifi a point befor the maximum yield is reach but still allow most econom benefit to be obtain from the fisheri similar definit can be made for refer point in other model 1122 data sourc the primari data sourc for estim biomass will be catch and effort these data are import not onli to estim biomass but to estim appropri catch and effort control survey densiti can also be use to estim biomass either as an index or in absolut term an index would requir less data to get a reason result and henc is less cost in order to ensur compar in estim the same survey must be repeat annual or everi few year and may be includ in the stock assess if an index of abund is use then the stock assess will need to estim a scale paramet that will rais the index to an estim of absolut abund absolut abund estim requir more sampl but do not requir in theori an extra scale paramet in the stock assess model and therefor the first estim can be use immedi a compromis for monitor could be to appli mani transect to obtain an absolut abund estim at the start of the time seri and thereaft to revisit a smaller proport of the origin transect perhap stratified6 by the observ conch densiti shortterm research may provid estim of potenti biomass growth for exampl monitor recoveri within close area may indic the potenti product rate such experi could be design and implement with fisher cooper 1123 assess model the simplest and most appropri oper model would be a biomass dynam model the logist model is use in the turk and caico island medley and ninn 1999 other model might be use but the logist popul model seem most applic without evid for altern the model can be fit to catch and effort time seri as well as ani other appropri index of popul size such as those base on fisheryindepend survey with enough contrast in the catch it can be fit in a spreadsheet eg punt and hilborn 1996 2001 1124 get start if a fisheri has no time seri of catch and effort or the time seri doe not includ both deplet and recoveri period it will not be possibl to appli classic stock assess method altern method must be use 6 stratif group the prospect sampl so that the popul in each group are as similar as possibl this allow more effici sampl in the sens that a lower varianc for the same sampl size is possibl 31 if survey estim of biomass are avail potenti yield can be estim assum that the survey estim the unexploit stock if fish is alreadi occur such potenti yield calcul are like to underestim the actual yield possibl from the stock the growth rate paramet estim k for conch vari from 02 to 07 year1 cfmc 1999 with the most reliabl estim for recruit conch be toward the lower end of this rang assum recruit at around two year old and postrecruit natur mortal and growth rate be about 03 and 02 year1 respect the msi would be around eight percent of the unexploit biomass beddington and cook 1983 sustain catch therefor need to be maintain at somewhat less than this amount if biomass is estim from a survey with a matur fisheri alreadi oper the survey will estim current biomass not unexploit biomass the msi estim from beddington and cook in such case would therefor be lower than the true msi the estim can still be use in a biomass dynam model or to estim fish mortal direct fish mortal is approxim the catch as a proport of the stock biomass a more general approach which can make use of all inform includ a survey if avail is to appli decis analysi the method use avail inform more effici and explicit take into account risk for this reason this approach is recommend the biomass dynam stock assess model is relat simpl requir onli a few paramet this make it particular appropri when time seri data are lack decis analysi need or may use the follow inform size of fisheri an estim of the current effort and catch in the fisheri is requir to provid the relev scale ani catcheffort data seri even a short seri without contrast can provid use inform fisher interview fisher can be interview to obtain their view on the product of the resourc while fisher may tend to be optimist they may be the onli sourc of time seri data and in particular the onli sourc on inform on what the unexploit state of the resourc was see appendix iii for an exampl of use onli these data current biomass from a resourc survey the current biomass can be incorpor with it uncertainti other data from other fisheri tradit paramet point valu from other fisheri are use in stock assess but this will underestim the uncertainti in the result decis analysi allow inform to be share as probabl distribut which includ uncertainti measur of cost of action and outcom it is often the case that a review of the potenti cost and benefit will allow a decis to be made even if inform of the likelihood of outcom is lack bayesian statist softwar exist allow various numer techniqu to be appli to model probabl distribut such as bay sa punt and hilborn 2001 which appli a bayesian approach to fit stock assess model these requir some expertis in use and develop model and data sourc one way that these data and model result can be combin is to use the new softwar pfsa 2003 see appendix iii the softwar requir that paramet estim be repres by 32 frequenc which can be deriv from various sourc and techniqu the paramet frequenc are use to model the paramet probabl distribut which can then be use in decis analysi data type that the softwar can use includ interview and catch and effort data for exampl as well as output from other softwar eg bay sa which can draw paramet frequenc from likelihood decis analysi will initi the manag process with clear defin refer point from the begin it will not be necessari to wait for scientif research to be complet and the inform can be updat smooth as more data from adapt manag becom avail howev the bayesian approach is potenti sophist and may requir some expert help 1125 recommend the requir for onli a few paramet make the biomass dynam model the recommend approach it has been shown to fit long term time seri data from at least one conch fisheri medley and ninn 1999 the assess model in the absenc of prove a better altern should be the logist popul model even where no histor inform exist share inform among countri may allow an initi stock assess to be conduct and then updat as inform becom avail where a suitabl time seri of catch and effort is not avail the beddington and cook approach combin with an estim of current biomass and if avail an estim of unexploit or light exploit biomass can provid use inform on potenti yield until suffici data exist for more reliabl analys it is recommend that decis analysi is use this not onli allow assess when data are lack but is transpar and allow explicit applic of the precautionari approach 113 perrecruit assess 1131 indic and refer point perrecruit assess focus on fish mortal as the main indic and control variabl spawnersperrecruit measur the rate at which the spawn stock is replenish at differ level of fish mortal in yieldperrecruit the aim is to find a fish mortal level to achiev a particular level of yield for each conch recruit to the fisheri the yield can be adapt to convert to process meat yield or valu perrecruit measur can also be use to monitor and interpret mean meat weight see appendix ii the method will also allow size select to be address for exampl the impact of a minimum size or flare lip onli control can be assess use yieldperrecruit in general estim of current fish mortal and the size at first captur or a full select function are requir initi size is easi to obtain but general fish mortal and select can be difficult fish mortal is usual relat to fish effort refer point are heavili depend on the growth model and natur mortal estim work has been conduct on this but wider agreement is requir on standard default model and paramet to use if agreement could be reach by scientist on these model the way would be pave for region agreement on harmon control such as minimum size 33 a limit refer would be fmsi although this doe not alway exist in yieldperrecruit model which may estim that yield will continu to increas without limit for increas fish mortal yield begin to fall after this point so there is absolut no reason for fish mortal to exceed it although fmsi is often at a higher level than desir for econom benefit or to protect the spawn stock it may still be use as a limit refer point f01 alway exist and in the absenc of econom inform can be use as a target refer point it has often been found to be close to the econom optimum when more data becom avail it will be necessari for a spawnersperrecruit analysi to be conduct as well as yieldperrecruit to manag the fisheri proper fish mortal must be maintain at a level that doe not reduc spawner biomass to too low a level there is current no standard spawnersperrecruit refer point for conch one will need to be develop base on the conch life histori and biolog and base upon experi in other fisheri see mace and sissenwin 1993 1132 data sourc the main data sourc for conch would be catchats composit which can be collect rapid rapid collect is an import advantag of this assess approach to estim mortal howev size must be convert to age as there is no way to age conch direct it will be import to have a good growth model catch size composit will depend on two factor size composit of the popul will depend on age composit and growth variat in it turn age composit will depend on the recruit histori of the stock and histori of mortal select of the fish method will decid which size conch are more like to be caught as collect method are basic the same select will depend on the distribut of the popul by size and the distribut of fish effort support scientif research should produc inform import to interpret size frequenc data research is need to estim growth model paramet and select and to link yieldperrecruit fish mortal to the chosen indic eg effort data may includ more complex expens method such as tag in the short term as well as standard monitor data an import but relat simpl requir in fisheri is the abil to convert between differ measur for exampl convers will be requir between shell length and weight lip thick sex matur process and unprocess meat weight convers paramet can be estim use general linear model 1133 estim of indic and refer point refer point requir growth and natur mortal model either previous publish model or paramet can be use cfmc 1999 or special scientif research can be conduct to estim them for each fisheri also these two sourc of inform could be combin use decis analysi 34 fish mortal must be estim for each fisheri proxi variabl such as fish effort can be use but will need to be convert to fish mortal for interpret in a yieldperrecruit context inaccur select model are perhap the greatest weak of the classic method an altern still base on yieldperrecruit would depend on develop appropri statist for appli decis rule eg see appendix ii these approach can bypass critic dubious assumpt but ultim still depend on growth and mortal model 1134 get start length and weight composit can be obtain immedi as long as growth and mortal model are avail these can be interpret although they can be obtain immedi mortal estim from length or weight convert catch curv are probabl unreli they do not take into account growth variabl and requir most of the catch to be young anim it is also necessari to know the sizeag select of the method use in the collect of the sampl eg the fisheri in order to be abl to estim the true length or weight distribut from the sampl the decis rule describ in appendix ii base on an observ catch composit could be use to provid immedi manag advic clear immedi monitor of the proport of matur anim be land could also be use to appli a decis rule such rule would at least indic the appropri level of control to appli initi while monitor continu 1135 recommend a good growth model is requir for yieldperrecruit assess a number of growth model and paramet estim exist these need to be assess and a final accept method for model meat weight growth propos result are sensit to paramet valu so precis and uncertainti would have to be consid estim is a signific problem for yieldperrecruit approach convers of size to age is problemat and may prove imposs as conch cannot be age direct it is necessari to reli on convers use a growth model such model are not necessarili reliabl for individu anim as variat in individu growth may be high and size doe not increas percept with age beyond matur use of meat weight should revolv around a decis rule rather than absolut refer point for exampl see appendix ii this allow greater flexibl as well as deal effect with uncertainti decis rule could be develop for reject or allow export base on sampl for exampl as well as appli manag control while develop a decis rule may be sophist appli it should be veri straightforward yieldperrecruit and requir more inform than a biomass dynam model howev their abil to use size frequenc which can be collect quick make the perrecruit method use at least as a comparison to the result from the biomass dynam model ultim they may replac biomass model as the primari sourc of manag advic as they allow assess of select which may prove import 35 114 other assess the natur extens to these assess approach would combin the dynam aspect of the biomass dynam model with the growth and mortal model such age structur dynam model allow recruit to be monitor and ultim model howev they have a veri high demand for data includ a time seri of catch effort and size frequenc as well as reliabl growth to age convers it is not possibl to appli this approach at this time 12 longterm popul monitor 121 popul assess longterm monitor would depend on be abl to generat annual catchperunit effort cpue by fish ground cpue is the indic of choic to monitor biomass as it is usual the cheapest method and can be maintain over a long time period short break in the seri do not creat a problem but total catch time seri must be complet total catch measur the impact of the fisheri on the stock and must be record and be avail it is import that the catch and effort monitor be robust to chang in avail capac such monitor should form a core activ of the manag and scientif author much of the monitor of commerci catch should use record complet by processor and other purchas the scientif author need the abil to collect to check and to store these data if possibl stock survey can be conduct to provid a fisheri independ assess of biomass such survey are valuabl as they provid a check on cpue as well as provid an independ assess on the scale of the fisheri such survey are often use in fisheri to improv assess if cpue is be monitor well howev they need not be frequent the main concern with use cpue is that there will be chang in catchabl catchabl is a measur of the portion of the biomass caught by a unit of

fish mortal relat control the rule would also allow manag to evalu control in relat to select see appendix ii for an exampl of a simpl decis rule 36 a rule base on onli land conch with flare lip the rule would be appli to enforc select by fisher to take onli matur conch it need to be verifi that a meat weight control can be use to enforc this it should be note that prescript region control could have a detriment effect on some fisheri in particular differ select among fisheri remain a problem where free dive is the sole gear matur conch that have escap the fisheri can be found in deeper water in abund a polici shift emphasi to larg conch could encourag exploit of the spawn stock which is probabl best left alon in these fisheri there should therefor be scope for some flexibl in control at the nation level and possibl even at the local level 13 control and monitor 131 introduct stock assess are onli use where they lead to some control on the level of fish manag author must be prepar to limit and reduc fish activ where requir to protect the resourc ani control aim to improv the stock state must reduc catch at least in the short term if they do not reduc catch they are not be effect for exampl put marin reserv where fisher do not fish will have no posit effect although it may reduc problem later reduc catch can make control unpopular with fisher but it is up to manag to minim problem through consult and joint decisionmak and to demonstr the advantag of the control to fisher through emphasi on longer term benefit experi has shown that it is alway necessari to consid the socioeconom effect of control enforc will at best be difficult if the need of industri and fisher communiti are not taken into account everi effort should be made to appli control which not onli achiev biolog object but socioeconom one as well as overfish is the worst socioeconom outcom for a conch fisheri it should be possibl to find some level of control that satisfi most realist object in case where socioeconom depend on a conch stock exceed the sustain product potenti of the stock the socioeconom need can onli be met by extern intervent either by provid shortterm support dure restructur or by assist fisher to find altern livelihood 132 fleet capac and effort all commerci vessel should onli be allow to fish if they are regist and licens by the manag author the number of licenc issu for conch should be commensur with the number of vessel need to harvest the resourc if fleet capac is much greater than the allow effort there is like to be tremend econom and polit pressur to allow greater fish activ fleet capac in commerci fisheri must therefor be control both number and size fish power of vessel can be control by limit registr effort and fish mortal may be control by limit the number of day that the regist and henc legal vessel spend at sea close season may allow this but specif effort control 37 are often difficult to administ enforc closur of process plant may also allow some control 133 catch quota catch quota will control fish and at least export can be enforc howev they requir care monitor of the stock and of the catch and can easili allow overfish for exampl set the quota to the maximum sustain yield is inher unstabl and will alway lead to overfish the resourc it is recommend catch quota are use alongsid other control to be appli it will be necessari to be abl to convert catch quota to export quota accur all export need to have a cite certif so quota could be enforc at this point if all or near all of the commerci catch is export convers need to be monitor as meat yield may chang with the size composit of the catch fish mortal can be relat to catch in the form of a feedback system lower catch quota will lower f but set the precis quota to achiev a particular fish mortal will be difficult use biomass dynam model will allow direct estim of appropri quota 134 minimum size and matur minimum size should be relat to growth and size at matur in general unless the shell is land minimum size is difficult to appli the meat size composit may indic violat of a flare lip rule onli matur conch allow but onli gross violat may be detect henc minimum size may prove less use for direct enforc but remain a use indic of the perform of other control a control requir fisher to onli take conch with a flare lip would requir cooper from fisher it would be possibl to prevent immatur conch from be land and this may be a use control in the noncommerci sector it would requir a fair sophist educ awar campaign howev 135 close area there may be effect close area alreadi present in some countri through gear control fisheri which onli allow free dive eg turk and caico island have de facto protect deep water popul otherwis proper design close area could be use for reduc risk of overfish by protect a portion of the stock 136 close season in general close season can be use for four purpos to protect the stock dure critic period such as spawn to gain from growth by delay recruit to the fisheri this would requir that the speci has a discret recruit period to reduc effect fish mortal by reduc the number of day in which fish can occur this would be the most like use of a close season as a biolog control to achiev socioeconom altern for exampl a close season may allow a quota to be spread more even through the year 38 whether close season are use for ani of the abov purpos will be up to manag stakehold and scientist in local fisheri 137 taxat taxat on export might be use to rais revenu to pay for fisheri manag manag cost govern money yet fisher should gain signific benefit from good manag export tax are one mean to help pay for this manag import taxat also discourag overfish by lower the effect price paid for conch

indefinit although not all step may be conduct in everi year there should also be close consult with stakehold dure this cycl for exampl at step 3 5 and 6 the stock assess should be undertaken to updat indic and refer point with new data as appropri all technic aspect of the stock assess should be fulli document includ a descript of the data use method appli and assumpt made model and data should be store for futur refer this make updat the assess in the futur much more rapid the assess should report separ to manag the stock status and the manag advic full technic inform on the stock assess will not be requir in this report and a nontechn summari should be submit to decisionmak this should make clear the uncertainti in the assess 39 for discret chang of state for exampl from fulli exploit to stock rebuild it is recommend that decis rule are use to specifi the manag action eg see figur 2 decis rule should alreadi be agre by decisionmak so the scientist job should be to evalu the rule and report back the evalu this should make communic of result more straightforward it is recommend that the rule appli should follow a system similar to that shown in figur 2 if the stock is alreadi low or the stock size fall below a particular prespecifi level a rebuild plan should appli this will lead to set lower effort or quota than the sustain yield allow the stock to grow a principl is need such as the time to rebuild to set a particular level of fish henc the exact plan would have to be develop through consult between scientist manag and stakehold adapt manag can activ appli manag measur to gain inform about the resourc the main problem with mani stock assess is that they requir contrast in the catch time seri ideal the time seri should includ period of both deplet and

younger select will not onli affect the popul in the same way as fish mortal but if select chang the size composit and averag weight will chang as recruit fluctuat so the relat abund of young small anim will chang in the catch control mean size by itself will be inadequ in protect the stock in observ ani particular catch composit it may be difficult to interpret the mean with respect to the under popul from which the catch is drawn for exampl a high proport of matur conch in the catch may indic that the stock is healthi with a larg spawn stock it may also indic that recruit has fail and fisher are switch to deplet the spawn stock in deeper water 2 refer point mean size could be use for two purpos if mean size can be link to the proport of the catch which is matur some minimum size can be set to ensur that this proport remain high conceptu this will help to ensur that anim are onli exploit onc they have had a chanc to spawn and that the spawn stock will be maintain interpret such a polici in term of fish mortal will depend on select but in general the implic would be that the fisheri is direct at the matur stock and that spawn would be less like to be affect even a high

suggest the asymptot size of 240 g is probabl too small carri out the procedur for a more realist 300 g asymptot size suggest an optim mean meat weight of 236 g and that 199697 is veri close to this optimum ie fulli exploit the growth model is determinist in this analysi a slight more sophist approach would allow the model to describ the mean growth and allow for growth variabl further work would allow uncertainti in paramet valu to be repres decis rule are particular good at cope with uncertainti as they allow the cost of make the wrong decis to be explicit taken into account 55 appendix iii

catchabl fish mortal to be estim rapid field test in the turk and caico island was use to test whether interview can be reli upon to provid sensibl manag advic it was shown in the turk and caico case that interview provid advic which if appli in 1974 would be expect to have obtain much greater benefit from the fisheri than that which was obtain under no catch control 56 1 turk and caico island retrospect analysi the exampl illustr an import tenet of the precautionari approach that a lack of inform should not be use as a reason to delay action method exist such as parfish for which data can be both rapid collect and inexpens these can lead to make decis in the short term which will be a veri great improv over take no action use interview data in the assess it was test against standard catch and effort stock assess use decis analysi see pfsa 2003 interview were conduct in juli 2003 to obtain stock assess inform from fisher the turk and caico island has a 30year catch and effort time seri which can generat not onli an assess for comparison with the interview decis analysi but also can indic what would have happen had a quota base on the interview been appli it was of interest to see how well manag would do if action were base onli on the interview data the fisheri is manag through a quota so this is the appropri control a standard stock assess use the logist model fit to the catcheffort time seri indic the current quota of 1675 million pound as too high and recommend lower it to 16 million pound land weight use the prefer inform the stock assess base upon both the interview and catcheffort model combin and the catcheffort model alon suggest a lower quota around 153 and 138 million pound respect interview by themselv are much less accur as indic by the much lower limit control but nevertheless recommend a target of 168 million pound reason close but abov the other target tabl 9 target and limit control for the turk and caico island conch fisheri base on catcheffort and interview data scenario target control interview and catcheffort 153125407 model combin interview data onli 167810340 catcheffort model onli 138488267 limit control 158085529 79165155 143269619 if it is assum that fisher knew as much in 1974 as they do now we can use the interview data as repres of what would have been obtain had the interview been conduct at the begin of the time seri henc the interviewon target quota can be appli at that point to see what might have happen to the fisheri had this stock assess method been appli assum that the logist and maximum likelihood paramet estim are correct the actual total catch over the period was 4547 million pound had the 168 million pound quota been appli the result suggest a total catch of 4700 million pound this quota would realiz higher catch in the longer term by forego higher catch in the late 1970s a discount rate of around 5 percent yield approxim the same net present valu between the two option the real gain howev would have been the rise in catch rate figur 6 the catcheffort model suggest the stock was in an overfish state in 1974 and an enforc quota would have led to stock recoveri in other word the catch would be met with much less work and cost than is now appli from 3 300 boat day down to 2 500 boat day to realiz the same catch it indic consider benefit to use just interview in this case but would need more test to 57 make the case as a general statement in particular in case where it turn out the logist is not the best model it need to be shown that interview may still have valu in set

the fit logist model and the project cpue with 168 million pound quota the cost of appli the quota is that without the deplet in the mid 1980s less inform would now be avail on the behaviour of the stock so that the current stock assess would be less reliabl this problem would have to have been address through increas research activ 58 trda0184e11105500

framework in place doe not proper address all the requir for the effect manag of conserv need at the countri level the theoret premis of this studi is that the concept of angr manag mix and harmon

regulatori framework for angr manag is to be extens and systemat some of the element that an upgrad regulatori framework should includ are the follow with regard to angr conserv and improv aspect to

conclus angr play an import role in contribut to food and agricultur product global for the present and the futur and in sustain most product system and communiti livelihood their valu encompass social cultur and econom aspect better manag of these resourc is crucial in meet the demand for food and in enabl futur generat to respond to the challeng of diseas climat chang and other threat it is against this background that the present studi has tri to draw renew attent to the import of a regulatori framework for angr manag and assess the status of nation legisl in place with a view to pave the way for legisl upgrad the follow remark can be made base on the review of the intern framework and the assess of nation legisl in place 621 the complex of the livestock sector there is hard an ideal way of manag genet resourc it is certain appropri to point out howev that genet resourc encompass not onli plant but anim as well and that there are some intrins differ between plant and anim resourc and the way they can be manag such differ relat to reproduct storag and transport ownership and cost associ with genet improv programm problem of product and divers in the livestock sector are no less complex than in the crop sector if anyth they are more challeng unlik in the case of crop where germplasm divers can general be captur in a few kilogram of seed with anim one has to maintain a veri larg gene pool in order to manag and maintain a reason order of divers furthermor the adapt of anim to their habitat may be far stronger than in the case of seed in addit anim unlik plant have feel mood and prefer the relationship between anim keeper men women children and their communiti and anim is somehow differ from the relationship between farmer and crop or soil livestock is multifunct in scope provid food meat milk egg fibr wool hide and skin draught power manur and fuel sinc in most region anim are an integr part of farm system the conserv of anim germplasm is not total independ from the conserv of habitat sociocultur and 98 the legal framework for the manag of anim genet resourc ecolog knowledg system and interact between differ speci and even ecosystem in the case of transhum livestock in addit with regard to angr there is not the same magnitud of invest in the public sector as that in exist for plant gene bank are consid use tool for exsitu conserv of plant but less so for anim there is no equival of a global genet repositori system for angr such as the consult group on intern agricultur research nor is there ani indic that such exsitu global conserv effort will be implement in the near futur these differ mean that action aim at maintain farm anim and farm plant biodivers will also differ but this must not undermin the need for legisl in both field at the nation level the develop of adequ angr legisl is not an easi task especi for develop countri sinc ideal it should strike a balanc between conserv and sustain use on the one hand and maxim of nation export potenti on the other the assess of nation legisl has also highlight the complex interact of sever area of regul that have an impact on angr manag 622 limit intern attent on angr the intern agenda seem to reflect limit attent on angr and in particular angr for food and agricultur the import of the manag of angr has been neglect to date by the intern communiti and govern as a consequ angr lag behind plant genet resourc at the intern level conserv of anim germplasm has not receiv as much attent in recent year as that of crop germplasm the same is true for util and breed improv particular in low extern input system although domest anim divers was recogn intern as an import compon of global biodivers by the un confer on environ and develop unc 1992 the cbd and agenda 21 formal intern activ on the sustain use and conserv of angr for food and agricultur are still veri limit compar to those on plant genet resourc the recent adopt of the itpgrfa is a selfexplanatori exampl of the intern debat and interest focus main on plant genet resourc the legal framework for the manag of anim genet resourc 99 with the except of the cbd which refer to anim genet materi in it definit of genet resourc no specif refer to angr exist in intern agreement and convent the wto sps agreement is the onli agreement whose implement at nation level seem to be cover by the extend zoosanitari legisl this is in respons to the sps agreement requir to establish nation sps measur consist with intern standard guidelin and recommend it is to be born in mind that if nation requir result in a greater restrict of trade a countri may be ask to provid scientif justif demonstr that the intern standard in question would not provid the same level of health protect consid appropri by that countri the biosafeti protocol to the cbd is be implement through nation legisl while most of the attent has focus on gm crop biotechnolog is also relev to both livestock breed and feed the peculiar of livestock will requir greater specif attent as the regulatori framework for biotechnolog develop trip and ipr are not a major concern at present in maintain farm anim genet divers in the anim sector technolog resourc and contractu practic rather than formal ipr strategi have been the norm to date the major of countri worldwid have explicit exclud patent for anim it will be interest in the futur to see whether ipr protect will nevertheless be sought and obtain in countri that exclud patent for anim under form other than patent or through patent of singl isol anim gene 623 the way forward the discuss on access and benefitshar between the provid and the user of plant genet resourc is quit intens access and benefitshar which is regul by the cbd the bonn guidelin and as it relat to plant genet resourc for food and agricultur the itpgrfa is not yet a major issu in the discuss of farm angr but may becom so in the futur it should be recal in fact that conserv sustain use access and equit share are among the concept develop under the cbd which recogn the sovereign right of state over their natur resourc and their author to determin access condit to such resourc it is the 100 the legal framework for the manag of anim genet resourc respons of state to develop general legisl with regard to the requir of the convent which also request the develop of nation strategi and develop plan such strategi and plan should not onli focus on plant but also consid the peculiar of angr with regard to both conserv and util as well as access and benefit share some factor are put pressur on the intern communiti and nation govern to develop regulatori system or implement the exist one give particular attent to angr conserv incorpor all oper involv in the manag of genet resourc

domest anim speci addit countri are like to becom increas interdepend in seek access to uniqu angr from elsewher in this case it may be worth consid the need to have facilit multilater access regul as

survey and anecdot evid provid clear insight as to the natur of gender represent across the industri although the data show that improv have been made in the number of women hold technic profession

that it is indic of the whole industri and in most if not all particip countri 11 the role of women in the industri in term of senior level and posit of decisionmak and respons the data and feedback confirm that it was overwhelm unbalanc in favour of men this was true in all the sector and countri studi although there was evid that more women held senior posit in the public sector though even here the balanc still clear favour men what the inform doe suggest is that women in the forestri sector are primarili employ in administr and support role with profession women forest tend to have specialist role ie research or firstlin junior manag posit moreov there is limit inform either quantit or qualit on the number and role of women in contract or selfemploy forestri work as here especi women seem to be invis exampl of good practic howev have been emerg which prove that concert and sustain commit and plan at the most senior organiz level can result in quantifi improv in the number of

is demonstr in the unit state forestri servic and detail in section 115 the relat low level of femal represent both in term of critic mass and level of senior profession role is in stark contrast to the feedback from all respond countri that genderequ is perceiv as an import issu in societi this was evidenc through referenc nation govern and intern ie unit nation polici and initi combin with legisl measur to enforc equal this is further underlin by the fact that all particip countri confirm that gender equal chang gender situat in forestri was also consid to be an issu within their

in access suffici robust data sourc across all sector of the industri and for all countri the data the tos collect clear show that women are underrepres this combin with research studi survey work and anecdot evid strong indic that this is the prevail situat across the whole industri inde a recent studi prepar for the european forest sector outlook studi show that the share of women in forestri is low in all countri see section 13 poschen 2003 despit countrylevel differ in detail and emphasi a number of common theme have emerg the status of women in forestri is a reflect of the explicit and implicit valu of societi influenc by the same cultur social and histor factor that have made it difficult for women to enter and progress in the general labour market this can be underpin by percept of male and femal role tradit of inherit legislatur and infrastructur that serv to endors differ between work and childrear respons such percept and valu can becom stereotyp which drive expect and pressur around male and femal work both in term of work content and work pattern this may indic a situat where women are activ select against forestri employ the number of women in forestri and forestryrel cours tend to be relat low as compar with men a pattern that has been around for at least a decad onc student howev women are just as success as men the reason as to whi so few women studi forestri would benefit from further research and more case studi although exist research and anecdot evid suggest that there is a lack of awar of forestri as a potenti career and that career advic is general nonexist or negat about the industri the industri also seem to have a poor imag either in term of a prevail percept of heavi manual work or associ with forest destruct and environment disregard the industri current seem to do littl to counterbal these negat imag the status of the industri in some countri therefor doe littl to promot it as a good career option for women in addit at least in some countri the econom condit within the sector have forc mechan reduc employ and restructur of the sector offer less job gender structur in forestri organ the fact that the industri is a high maledomin work environ may be a deterr to mani women who may feel that there is like to be discrimin and that their opportun for career develop may be hinder although there doe not appear to be ani direct research evid on this issu it is a factor highlight as a deterr to women consid other maledomin industri eg construct and engin in term of the current workforc there is clear evid of discriminatori practic against women in the past this has been veri explicit and in certain sector anecdot evid suggest this is still veri much the case although in mani countri the situat has improv sinc the introduct of equal legisl sinc the introduct of this legisl discrimin appear to have becom more implicit mani women in the industri refer to the cultur be close to them reminisc of a men club with male focus valu and standard there are few opportun offer within forestri work for parttim or flexibl work this impact women more than men becaus women are more often than not respons for childcar respons survey work and anecdot evid suggest that women are reluct to request flexibl work due to concern over their career prospect this can result their leav the industri complet howev survey studi also indic that modern forestri work should be abl to accommod more flexibl work than it current appear to offer the gender imbal is particular preval within manag role especi at senior level women forest howev are like to be just as wellqualifi as men the fact that they are still fail to achiev senior posit suggest previous and ongo discrimin at an explicit or implicit level 13 123

famili and friend or through the support of teacher or career advis at school research in these countri howev suggest that career advic on forestri is at best ambival and at worst negat probabl there are way and opportun to educ career advis and teacher of the career possibl that forestri offer and to improv the guidanc current offer to children therefor educ advis and teacher would help to rais

public sector in general are the biggest employ of femal forest while forest industri organ are the most common employ of male forest although the reason for the differ in the employ profil of male and femal forest have not been thorough analys kaipainen 1998 posit that femal forest may have experienc more difficulti in find work in the tradit forestri sector probabl this has led women to seek employ outsid the forestri sector as they are reluct to remain without a job it is like that it has also encourag women to accept job below their educ level and outsid their specialti asplund 1986 uncertainti in femal forest career has increas rather than decreas unemploy and temporari employ is more common among femal forest than with male forest in 2003 32 percent 31 chang gender situat in

forest 32 in kaipainen studi 1998 90 percent of men and about 80 percent of women believ their employ suit their educ howev it is clear from the research materi that more men are in top manag posit

concern the employ situat of finnish male and femal forest and their career develop path the studi have reveal that women forest have tradit been employ more often outsid the tradit forest sector than their male colleagu further research examin this specif aspect need to be carri out to determin the reason whi this is occur at present the employ situat concern femal forest seem to be somewhat weaker than their male counterpart accord to a studi by suutari 2003 the most import step for student is at the point when they finish univers and accept their first job therefor becaus the recruit

in an organ and structur domin by men in term both of number as well as posit although the number of women with forestri degre has increas substanti previous studi lidestav and 1998 ringsel 2000 have suggest that femal forest are less satisfi with their job than their male colleagu are within most forestri sphere gender mark is still so obvious that women stand out as deviant and they constant have to justifi their presenc brandth and haugen 1998 brandth et al 2004 reed 2003 the best chanc to becom accept and esteem seem to be as expert in a more and more special field or when work with educ and dissemin of knowledg brandth and haugen 1998 brandth et al 2004 a gender divis of area and function at both a horizont and a hierarch level appear when compar contemporari occup in sweden between men and women with a degre in forestri lidestav and 1998 in educ inform and supervis of law as well as in subordin posit the proport of women correspond fair well to the proport of femal graduat howev if we look at the proport of women in higher posit within manag harvest oper silvicultur or work as expert the amount is lower than the proport of graduat as long as there are few women who studi forestri there will also be few women in the workforc and as long as young women do not find forestri as an attract field one that offer them good possibl to acquir interest job and have career receiv an equal salari there will be a minor of women in the forestri sector further within organ busi and author a gender organiz logic is at work which not onli reproduc a structur of gender divis but also paradox make gender invis wahl et al 2001 wahl 2003 differ profession posit in organ have a more or less determin gender charact and women in maledomin profess or workplac often face problem of fit in magnusson 1998 in all this can be express by the concept of gender the follow section present the result from a critic discours analysi of forest profess lidstav and 2005 specif it is the discours of forest supervisor a person with a degre in forestri and employ by one of the counti forestri board and forest ranger employe with higher forestri educ employ by privat or public forest enterpris the analysi is base on written text and imag about the forestri profess publish in some major nation forestri magazin in 1990 and 1991 and in 2000 and 2001 chang gender situat in forestri the question address was how do women fit in with the forestri profession discours the studi lidestav and 2005 reveal that a fifth of the magazin text includ women and around half of these mark gender or deal explicit with equal issu this percentag is signific higher 72 than the amount of women work in the field but the represent question is more complex there is a strong common featur in the materi that was studi that either the author of the text or the person interview emphas that gender has noth to do with forestri profess this pattern to make gender a nonissu seem to be a joint interest between differ actor male and femal within the discours there are veri few except and for the women in particular this appear to be a more or less conscious strategi to get access to and be accept in the field brandth et al 2004 also found similar result when studi the norwegian forestri press for the organ and their male repres the motiv to make gender invis can be interpret as a way to maintain the status quo and 1996 howev onli a small number of text appli a kind of essentialist approach point out that there are profound differ between the sex some of them claim that this is an advantag other say it is a fault that need to be mend either through women adjust or by make use of more and better technolog three main type of argument often mix togeth have been identifi as be use to increas the amount of femal forest work in the field one is a deficit argument where women are view as an underus resourc which could solv the predict lack of manpow in the year to come within the industri apart from the reason we have also identifi a renew argument in which femal are seen as desir modern in a relat conserv cultur in need of chang cf brandth and haugen 1998 the last type of argument concern legitimaci the forest industri rank veri low compar to other sector when it come to gender equal this creat a lack of legitimaci in relat to the surround societi cf brandth et al 2004 a larger proport of femal ranger and supervisor and their expect revit innov effort is suggest as a way to solv the legitimaci problem that the forestri field suffer from anoth import result from the analysi concern gender is the notion that femal forest frequent receiv their legitimaci as profession through a man cf reed 2003 the studi narrat are full of exampl where the portray forest refer to their own father or some other male mentor from whom they have been given access to the forestri field and it treasur no equival femal role model appear in these stori lidestav and 2005 dure the tenyear studi period it seem as veri littl has chang in term of gender rather the discours continu to reproduc a manifest portrait of the ideal forest as a man be hardwork and abl to master natur this hegemon masculin is to a larg extent form around a rural masculin ident gender structur in forestri organ includ for exampl a strong interest in hunt and wildlif connel 1995 brandth and haugen 2004 at the same time femal forest appear to need a male mentor in order to enter the field becaus it is through such a helper that they seem to receiv legitimaci as profession these stereotyp gender pattern do not make it easi for women or men for that matter to fit in within the field even though the forestri industri has undergon signific chang and there is a concern about futur lack of manpow etc few sign of reform concern the current gender structur and equal issu can be observ in the studi represent on the contrari there is a strong tendenc in the forestri press to state that gender doe not matter both men and women within the forestri field appli this univers strategi which could be interpret as a way to avoid ani kind of feminist stigma brandth et al 2004 as reed 2003 analysi of forestri work and gender relat in canada reveal it is import to keep in mind in this context that gender relat are form by both men and women a phenomenon that is also illustr here lidstav and 2005 break into the forestri discours is hard work conclud brandth and haugen 1998 in their longitudin analysi of the norwegian forestri discours have review the result of women attempt to gain influenc but as indic by their research with minim success the same can be said about the swedish case lidstav and 2005 it appear to be hard work to break the domin masculin forestri discours overal the discours reproduc the tradit maledomin cultur and offer veri few altern this has social impact and affect the opportun for individu to identifi with and to choos to be a profession forest even so one

mani women still believ they are discrimin against either explicit or implicit this is someth they have come to accept as inher to work in the industri research into other industri and in the british forestri industri itself suggest that organiz cultur and valu set have a major impact on how recognit and reward are alloc often subconsci senior manag seek a fit with the exist cultur which is frequent predomin male this stereotyp pervad the whole industri and influenc decis on recognit promot and opportun for train gender structur in forestri organ and develop vinnecomb et al 1999 the

mani women made it veri difficult for them to achiev the same level of recognit and support anoth key factor is the loss of women to the industri and the difficulti of attract them in the first place this is exacerb by the lack of familyfriend provis and flexibl work option mani women are the main caregiv in the famili and face signific challeng in balanc work and famili commit it has been suggest that there is much more scope in forestri employ for greater work flexibl than there use to be howev employ still appear reluct to consid it possibl due to the perceiv and real addit cost involv increas legisl in this area is make the denial of flexibl work pattern increas difficult to achiev equal opportun legisl initi introduc in the unit kingdom in the mid1970 has had an impact on reduc explicit discrimin against women there is also more recent evid of increas commit to address the gender imbal especi in the public sector where there is ongo govern monitor and target set and larger employ howev much depend on how equal opportun polici and practic are implement at local level by line manag anecdot evid strong suggest there is a lack of consist here and that regardless of organiz polici discrimin still can and doe take place anoth key issu that appear to be a barrier to women enter the industri is a lack of awar as to what kind of job are avail combin with a somewhat negat imag of industri employ which tend to be stereotyp as lumberjack work there is a general lack of knowledg and understand of the opportun the industri offer and this is as preval for men as women career advic on forestri job in school and colleg is low where it is avail it can be negat portray as mani career advis do not perceiv the industri as offer profession role or good employ prospect forestri is not therefor general perceiv as a real career option and mani young peopl of either gender can face a barrier of opposit to ani interest they may have in forestri employ in view of the fact that the prevail imag of the industri is harvest and that veri few women actual in forestri express interest in harvest job perhap the lack of attract to the industri is obvious 77 chang gender situat in forestri 1143 what can be done to address the imbal the unit kingdom popul demograph show that a signific proport of the futur labour market growth will come from women particular work mother similar the number of white young 78 men the industri tradit target employ market will reduc such chang in the popul will impact the way organ recruit staff and the altern sourc they will be reliant on in the futur howev in the unit kingdom forestri is current a shrink industri with fewer job avail address the imbal will therefor be veri challeng even if there were a genuin sustain commit to do so becaus it would take so long for women to achiev critic mass more visibl seniorlevel commit to chang is requir across all sector to drive through chang in practic and especi cultur this may be more challeng in some sector than other equal opportun polici need to be implement and monitor more rigor to ensur fair and object manageri commit to facilit better flexibl work option could also be critic in retain women and men to the industri it is also import for the industri to chang the way it is perceiv on the outsid therebi make it more attract to men and women alik better qualiti career advic is need and a more proactiv approach will not onli build an awar of potenti job opportun but also increas and improv overal awar of this industri and it import work is also requir with the media especi the industri media to present a more balanc pictur of forestri work and show women in interest stimul job not just the occasion token women photograph again this need a more proactiv approach these point are as valid for the attract of men to the industri as well as women and as such may be prove to be more success in win support and gain influenc and momentum howev the unit kingdom forestri industri doe appear to be declin at present certain in term of employ opportun and it will be import to balanc ani potenti increas in suppli of women applic with demand avail of job it is also worth note that there has been a growth of forest area use for public access leisur sport and amen use rather than for timber product this has been particular preval within public sector and ngoown forest this has result in a differ rang of job be develop to manag such chang in forest use such as forest ranger wildlif offic etc these requir differ skill set than the more tradit forestri role often skill in which women appear to excel eg interperson and communic skill anecdot evid suggest that there are increas number of women work in these forestryrel role howev it is also

first phase was compos of four submodul evalu of literatur and secondari statist spatial analys partstandard interview and expert interview in the subsequ phase of evalu and assess the ascertain result were discuss with the local actor and resid in workshop 119 342 interview of the resid with the help of a partstandard questionnair primari survey were carri out in all three project area the questionnair is divid into four themat field the 230 peopl who particip were select by a random quota sampl 48 percent of them were women there are big differ in the way turkish migrant perceiv natur and urban natur natur is a term which has posit connot green 577 percent tree 439 percent forest 265 percent beauti 175 percent flower 169 percent etc wherea the exist of urban natur is often question by the interviewe norar natur 244 percent dens hous etc 195 percent the way natur and urban natur are understood or perceiv scarc seem to vari with the sex of the interviewe one differ is the word

they took advantag of this form of urban natur near everi day chang gender situat in forestri 343 expert interview expert had question put to them in both german and turkish in a public interview with a common theme there were two phase to this in the first exploratori phase three expert from gelsenkirchen were interview whose daili work acquaint them with the use and percept of urban natur of peopl with a turkish migrat background in total 17 expert were interview all work in the field be research and have either privileg access to inform about the studi group or to decisionmak process of the local author or the area administr the interview aim to deepen and extend the knowledg the project team alreadi had and to provid feedback to it all expert interview have stress unanim the high relev of an open space near the residenti area in dens popul innerc quarter accord to them the turkish migrant like the urban natur area and use them often although the industri woodland area are seldom visit they do offer a 120 larg futur potenti for intens use percept use and assess vari accord to age and gender the elder generat first migrat prefer privat garden to the public area and use them as among other thing kitchen garden the younger second generat take advantag of the public area of urban natur much more often for exampl by take walk wherea men will go to urban natur alon or

evalu much more posit than urban natur here negat associ such as nois and pollut are often mention especi possibl problem of soil contamin in the industri woodland howev the import function of urban natur ie the industri woodland for dens popul innerc quarter could be work out clear these form of natur play an import role in the improv of qualiti of life gender and percept of forest and forestri two further main result of the studi are an awar of the religi influenc on the assess of natur and the wish for a greater degre of landscap in contrast to the western popul it is obvious that the attitud to the daili use of natur by the turkish resid has been strong mould by islam their religion allot great import to conserv at everi stage of the studi the turkish resid predomin wish for a redesign of the industri woodland park for exampl with road network seat accommod and improv hygien through sanitari facil and fountain differ in the use of the industri woodland were in evid depend on the generat gender and the level of develop of the area the rheinelb industri woodland in gelsenkirchen are alreadi well known much frequent and popular they are physic close to the district and special action taken by the kindergarten and the school are improv the industri woodland and especi in their implement is a decis factor there are seven recommendaton which deriv from the result of the studi infobox recommend for action 1 more inform and communic more transpar plan the analys have reveal a deficit inform situat and a lack of multilingu communic that contribut to an underus and adopt of the industri woodland at the same time there is an increas demand for transpar in plan the confid of the citizen in activ particip can be gain by produc addit inform and better communic the current plan 2 greater secur in the wood both those with a turkish migrat background and the expert have describ the industri woodland as insecur owe to the fear of violent attack although these are subject percept such fear must be taken serious 3 more gendersensit plan the studi clear demonstr the low use of the industri woodland by turkish women and girl when they do use them it is general in the compani of other member of the famili it is therefor necessari to ascertain the need of femal and to develop gender sensit concept in common also need is a closedoff protect area within the woodland where women can go with their children 4 more cultur layout mix by mean of more landscap element road network the instal of seat accommod and the settingup of recreat area turkish famili can better use the woodland seat accommod for 121 chang gender situat in forestri instanc mark brokenoff tree trunk can be creativ integr into the concept a landscap element ask for by the turkish particip becaus of muslim rule on hygien are a water sourc or dispens and a fountain all other popul group too can benefit from such an instal 5 stronger activ of kindergarten and school the direct contact made recent by turkish famili with some kindergarten and school group has prove success howev a stronger and more systemat activ of the turkish popul through school and kindergarten is advis for the futur thus special skill that are necessari for a success access to the field are acquir at an earli stage 6 stronger integr of the turkish migrant communiti a prerequisit for the continu and success activ of the turkish popul is the integr of the turkish communiti and the migrant own organ mosqu club youth welfar sport and cultur club etc these multipli have alreadi shown their interest in futur cooper and made a substanti contribut to the research process 7 stronger particip of resid research desir 122 for the sustain plan and landscap of the area that also use the integr potenti of the industri woodland a greater integr of all popul group of the quarter with regard to age gender and migrat background is necessari 345 summari over the past decad crucial chang have taken place in the percept attitud demand and view on forest and forestri by societi review public opinion survey confer conclus and recommend case studi and research result prove that women seem to have differ percept on forest becaus they are more ecolog and societ awar and more critic about forestri measur concept of public particip and awar rais on sustain forest manag should take these observ and survey result into consider communic strategi should also be more mind that differ approach could be need for differ target group sustain forest manag has to improv it social aspect and in do so will learn that men and women have differ attitud to natur resourc and their manag women as decis maker and key consum should be address and their attitud and percept need to be taken into account and consid it is high recommend that research and administr group should includ the gender dimens of public percept in their agenda and work programm mean and action 4 mean and action 41 introduct sinc the unit

gender relat in the forest servic use theori and method of organiz sociolog first result of the project are expect in mid2006 the result will lead to recommend for a gendersensit implement of the

consid the polit goal of equal opportun in employ polici and gender aspect a low represent of women indic a need for reorgan and improv for exampl with the help of gender mainstream the final goal and

understand similar and differ in corpor cultur of forest servic in differ european countri for exampl the percentag of women forest ranger and of femal employe within the forest servic in portug is

product for subsist herb gather or plant for medicin fuelwood collect and smallscal forest industri produc cash product as well as often be the primari forest user women are activ and knowledg manag and caretak of the forest this overview of gender and forest manag and organ has shown that women have a complex relationship with forest and the forest sector it is clear that although women are signific user of forest product they rare have input into forestri decisionmak either at the macro or even at the micro level even though some countri have introduc polici to improv the represent of women in the forestri sector littl has been done to encourag or follow up on this and thus the situat in most case remain as it was befor the legisl was pass this is emphas in the avail statist on the forestri sector labour forc men domin the forestri sector workforc in most countri and usual earn more than their equal qualifi femal counterpart femal represent within the forestri sector in some countri seem to be heavili influenc by the tradit valu and percept of the role of women in societi polici gear toward equal opportun seem to have been impot to break this general idea even when women hold the major ownership of privat forest they are still margin in the decisionmak process one import lesson that may be learn from the case studi present here is that there is no quick fix for increas gender represent within the forestri sector as this overview indic there are a myriad of issu that have to be dealt with first which indirect or direct influenc the gender balanc in the forestri sector this synopsi about gender and forestri has also highlight the perceiv differ in the relationship to and the use and method of manag of natur resourc among women and men women are credit with be more critic of forest manag strategi perhap becaus they are more ecolog and social awar of forestri issu women in forestri have been organ themselv for more than 20 year these network

need opinion and interest of men and women these polici and programm must be support at all societ level for their implement to be success recommend the team of specialist believ that if there are to be ani improv in the current gender imbal in the forestri sector in europ and north america these issu should be put on the agenda at all level of the intern communiti govern privat sector and public sector the team of specialist further note that in septemb 1995 at the unit nation fourth world confer on women govern express their commit to creat a new develop paradigm that integr environment sustain with gender equal and justic within and between generat as contain in chapter 24 of agenda 21 howev sinc then veri littl has been done to meet this commit in fact and sad so mani of the conclus and recommend from the 1995 unit nation confer in beij and those from the april 2001 seminar on women in forestri still hold true today the team of specialist argu that the forestri sector can no longer afford to reli exclus on the 158 compet of a singl gender especi sinc women make 80 percent of the decis relat to household consumpt in mani countri there is a relat high proport of femal

be use to improv sustain forest manag practic and to improv communic strategi about these sfm practic and evid from other sector indic that genderbalanc organ function more effici summari and conclus

aV the grow global obes problem some polici option to address it abstract the last few decad have seen fundament chang in food consumpt pattern around the world these chang were character not onli by an increas in overal calori intak but also by a shift in the composit of the diet toward more meat egg dairi product as well as more fat and oil ie a shift toward high calori diet that are also much richer in satur fat and cholesterol the main driver of this transit includ factor such as i rapid fall real price for food ii urban with the develop of new market channel and the spread of supermarket into develop countri iii and freer trade and global with the emerg of larg transnate oper food compani this diet transit also brought about a rapid increas in the preval of overweight obes and relat noncommunic diseas ncds initi these problem were limit to develop countri but more recent there are grow concern that the advers effect of a rapid nutrit transit could even be more sever in develop countri the grow health concern have also given rise to a intens debat about possibl remedi to stop and revers the obes epidem in develop countri and perhap even more import to prevent similar develop in develop countri some of these polici option are be examin in this paper the instrument analys includ price intervent both at the level of primari commod and final consum good tax on fat food direct

ncds polici option 1 introduct the last two centuri have seen a fundament transform of diet in essenti all affluent countri at the begin of this transform was the agroindustri revolut of the

rigor applic of scientif advanc to tradit agricultur mechan genet improv and the develop of fertil and pesticid enabl a doubl and redoubl of food product within the time span of a few decad in fact product growth was so strong that growth in product comfort exceed growth in demand and afford a rapid grow popul more and better food at declin real price agricultur product growth also promot the industri of the then larg agrarian societi it help accumul capit free up labour and provid ever more and more nutriti food eventu a virtuous circl was creat where product growth rise incom and better nutrit becam mutual support and thus spur overal econom development2 at least for the nineteenth centuri howev these develop remain larg limit to industri countri it took more than a centuri befor the agroindustri revolut start to reach the first develop countri with the begin of the 1960s the same factor that had initi the agroindustri revolut in the develop world in the previous centuri got a foothold in the food and agricultur sector of part of the develop world the combin of modern varieti expans of irrig more and improv input suppli and the widespread mechan of product made more food avail to consum in develop countri sinc the earli 1960s the averag calori avail in the develop world has increas from about 1 950 to 2 680 kcalspersonday while protein avail near doubl from about 40 to 70 gpersonday the preval of undernourish declin from 37 percent in 1970 to 17 percent in 2000 and while more than 840 million of peopl n 2003 are still food insecur this is more often the result of advers local product condit war and civil strife a lack of incom and of access to food rather than the inabl of the world as a whole to produc and provid enough food as in the industri world of the nineteenth centuri consum in develop countri have benefit the most from advanc in agricultur product in real term food price have declin to the lowest level in histori and togeth with gain in broader econom growth have enabl consum today to eat better while spend less and less of their budget on food howev not all countri and region have benefit from these advanc in part of the develop word notabl in subsaharan africa these advanc have not even start to yield a meaning impact but in mani develop countri the progress in access to provid more better and cheaper food has been impressive3 the rapid declin in real food price has allow consum in develop countri to embark on food consumpt pattern that were reserv for consum in industri countri at much higher gross domest product gdp level today a consum in a develop countri can purchas more calori than ever befor and more than consum in industri countri ever could at compar incom level in china for instanc consum today have about 3 000

affect consumpt pattern essenti the entir popul growth over the next 30 year will be urban urban creat a new and improv market and distribut infrastructur attract supermarket and their sophist food handl system cold chain etc make for better road and port thus improv the access of foreign supplier and the import of import in the overal food suppli and all in all will promot a global of dietari pattern most import from a nutrit perspect these chang includ not onli a shift toward higher food energi suppli but also a shift toward more fat and oil and more animalbas foodstuff and thus higher intak of satur fat and cholesterol the shift in consumpt pattern and lifestyl have result in a rapid increas in the preval of obes and relat noncommunic diseas ncds in develop countri 2 fogel 1994 estim that half of the overal econom growth in franc and england in the nineteenth centuri was a result of better nutrit 3 while not all develop countri have benefit from rapid incom growth and nor

countri are in the process of undergo a similar nutrit transit see who 2003 with probabl even more advers health impact the main compound factor of these nutrit chang is a phenotyp and genotyp predisposit toward develop obes and ncds the phenotyp predisposit is the result of rapid transit from hunger and undernourish toward overnutrit and affluenc there is ampl empir evid that hunger and

could spark a rapid increas in the preval of obes and ncds in develop countri over the next generat the human and econom toll could be dramat and for mani the exit out of food poverti may be associ with a straight entri into health poverti this mean that while fewer peopl will suffer from hunger and chronic undernourish more will have health problem relat to obes and ncds the impact will be felt more strong than in develop countri as fewer consum in develop countri will be abl to afford the need medic treatment even if they can afford more food mani ncds have a lethal impact if left untreat the rapid increas of ncds also suggest that some of these concern have alreadi becom a realiti at least in develop countri phenotyp and genotyp predisposit for obes and ncds in develop countri in conjunct with the rapid nutrit transit toward higher calori avail in general and more livestock product in particular suggest that their popul may have to cope with an even bigger problem in a shorter

most popular propos to come to grip with the grow obes epidem and associ public health cost has been the propos of a tax on energyrich foodstuffs6 these propos are now be discuss by health offici and public policymak with a view to identifi their effect in reach their state object their effici relat to other measur and their shortfal and sideeffect in principl intervent could take place at two differ level the first would be to influenc produc price for food ie intervent at the agricultur produc level there is a long histori of such intervent in organis for econom cooper and develop oecd countri and an equal long debat about the effect and problem that have emerg with such intervent on agricultur but relat littl has been said about consum and food consumpt the second entrypoint for price intervent would be at the consum price level these intervent are current larg limit to surcharg in the form of valu ad tax vat and total or partial exempt from such vat surcharg the follow will tri to shed some light on possibl impact of the two type of intervent and will tri to provid answer that aris in the context of polici intervent the case for food price intervent the basic case for food price intervent rest on the notion that higher price could provid a mean to reduc excess food consumpt which is in turn associ with signific societ extern put differ the price of food energi set by a free market reflect the cost of produc the food rather than true cost which is the product cost plus the extern cost of treat ncds such as coronari heart diseas chd or noninsulin depend diabet mellitus niddm if food market fail to captur the full cost of excess consumpt a tax set at the level where product cost plus tax will equal the product cost plus extern cost would provid an econom effici solut but there may be import rejoind to the tax argument for instanc that a tax on excess food consumpt could be a regress tax as it creat an extra burden on peopl with higher calori need or lower incom moreov intervent on food price in a system of increas freer trade in food and agricultur are like to creat incompat with commit taken elsewher notabl those taken within the world trade organ wto not liber trade mean forego effici gain to be had from a better alloc of product which would need to be taken into account in the overal analysi of such a tax how effect and effici these tax are in practic and how compat they are with other polici reform will be discuss in the follow section price intervent at the produc level a tax on primari product as alreadi mention produc price intervent for food product are a common use tool of agricultur polici in develop and develop countri alik numer studi have analys their impact on agricultur farm household incom the environ or rural develop but relat littl is known about their impact on consum and food consumpt pattern in fact mani analys simpli assum that chang in produc price are fulli transmit to the consum level or that consum are implicit assum to chang their consumpt pattern accord to a chang in produc price intervent at the produc level have been subject to controversi polici debat particular those associ with higher border protect intervent price system and export subsidi ani suggest to increas such measur for the sake of possibl health benefit would 6 for detail of a recent debat at government level on a tax on fatti food in the unit kingdom see for exampl httpwwwtheagecomauarticles200402191077072753005htmlfromstoryrh or httpnewsbbccouk1hihealth3502053stm therefor add to an alreadi contenti debat and should be most care vet befor ani infer is drawn much of the rational put forward by the propon of agricultur price intervent rest on the observ that countri with massiv support to agricultur high produc price and high border protect are benefit from relat moder preval level for obes this relationship is depict in figur 1 which in fact suggest that the oecd countri with the highest produc support estim pse rate japan the republ of korea norway and switzerland have the lowest preval rate of obes while australia new zealand and the unit state all with low or middl level of protect are burden with relat high preval rate of obes the question that aris in this context is whether this relationship is of a causal natur ie whether it is a matter of correl or causat a necessari condit for a causal relationship is that a price increas at the level of the protect agricultur product has a substanti impact on final consum price the question therefor is how and to what extent price are transmit along the food chain and to what extent the valu share of farm product affect the final consum price a number of empir studi help to find an answer to this question eg wohlgen these studi show that i the valu share of primari product in the final consum good has been declin over time with rise valu share of servic includ in the product and ii that there are consider differ across commod for exampl veri low for wheatbread and high for egg the high servic element in the differ also mean that the margin between produc and consum price are typic much higher in develop than in develop countri for some product at least an increas in the produc price in a develop countri regardless of whether through higher border protect higher support price or a combin of the two may therefor not creat a sizeabl increas in consum price this suggest that a chang increas in produc price for food would in general be a rather blunt tool to chang food price at the consum level and thus have littl influenc on food demand figur 2 should help explain the channel that affect the transmiss of price from produc to consum figur 1 support for agricultur and the preval of obes obes is protection the antidot preval of obes and produc support to agricultur figur 2 exampl of the agricultur price format at support level and process margin the impact of a taxtariff with high margin oecd countri the impact of a taxtariff with low margin develop countri the upper pane of figur 2 depict the main factor that affect the horizont and vertic price transmiss for food product in a develop countri schmidhub and britz 2002 what is refer to as the horizont transmiss is essenti the transmiss of primari product price across the border from intern market to the domest commod market in mani oecd countri this process is often heavili affect by agricultur polici measur in this process the intern price format start from a low border price that is rais eg through a tariff to the level of the domest market price for produc this market price is further increas eg through a direct transfer to the level of the farm incent price which drive the level of input applic and alloc area the domest market price is where the vertic price transmiss process start it start with a wholesal oper cooper pool suppli from farmer the primari product cereal are then further process at various stage flour bran etc intermedi product are further refin differ type of flour ad to other product and eventu sold as the final consum good bread breakfast cereal etc by a retail supermarket bakeri in this multistag process the various agent often add consider margin for the process or market servic they provid as a result the valu share of primari good wheat eventu account for onli a small share of the final valu of consum good bread78 the situat is quit differ where primari product account for a larger valu share in the final consum good figur 2 lower pane not an atyp case for the price format in mani d e v e l o p i n g countri ani price increas at the produc level would translat into a more substanti increas in consum price and where consum are price respons result in a reduct of consumpt higher consum price for food in develop countri howev may also mean that other thing be equal undernourish may increas it also explain although doe not justifi whi mani develop countri have chosen to tax their agricultur to the benefit of urban consum rather than protect it from the consum point of view the impact of low share on the final product is in effect describ by marshal theori of deriv demand marshal 1920 ie that demand is typic fair inelast where the primari commod form onli a small compon of the final good it may therefor be more effici to levi a tax direct at the consum level again distinguish the impact of low and high price elast of demand price intervent at the consum level a tax on fat food a similar although in it impact somewhat differ approach to address the grow obes problem is the propos to levi a tax direct on consum price of food particular in develop countri the discuss has recent advanc from the theoret proposit to examin actual and oper issu public health officials9 in particular have been propos concret measur to increas the cost of energydens and satur fat rich food by ad an extra tax on energyrich food or reduc the food vat exempt that are still in place in mani countri while enthusiasm among public health advisor for such a tax is understand issu pertain to the econom effect and the oper effici of such measur in reduc obes are less clear again the effect of such a measur depend crucial on how respons consum of these food are to price chang induc by higher tax the elast use in the n2030 model10 in figur 3 give an idea of the general link between incom level and the respons of demand with respect to incom level they show a clear and strong declin of incom elast with rise incom and thus suggest that rich consum are like to react much less to a tax on certain food than poor consum 7 notabl consum price impact are onli like if tariff are extraordinarili high andor process and market margin are veri small rice in japan

document the possibl reaction of consum to price chang in various food item across a rang of incom strata they found that i consum in lowincom strata are more respons to price chang for certain food item than rich consum for exampl pork consum in the poorest strata are react three time as elast as consum in the richest strata and ii an increas in the price of a food tend to drive consumpt away toward it substitut they final conclud that increas in food price have much less favour effect for the poor guo et al 1999 where incom elast are low but substitut between the various foodstuff is high a priceinduc reduct of consumpt in a given good is associ with higher consumpt of it substitut in such a situat tax may well help to direct consumpt of singl food compon in the desir direct but the impact on overal energi intak are like to be limit if for instanc calori from anim fat are be tax consumpt of veget oil and fat is like to increase11 numer other sideeffect could result 11 as king 2002 put it if the govern regul the content of say fast food peopl will find fat elsewher a tax on anim fat for instanc should promot the product and consumpt of socal light product light yoghurt low fat milk etc while consum would tend to reduc foodstuff with high calori content but the excess fat is like to surfac elsewher in the food chain either domest or abroad one vent for surplus in mani develop market is the fast food and snack food industri that add extra fat and sugar to mani of it product includ ice cream hamburg and french fri if these junk food were to be tax the fat and sugar ad current to ice cream and hamburg would occur elsewher in the food chain if not domest the high calori part of a foodstuff could be export and end up in develop countri a case in point is poultri meat where rich economi alreadi consum predomin the lean part breast while the fattier part leg quarter wing are primarili export with possibl advers effect on the food consumpt pattern and agricultur economi of those countri that import them anoth problem with a tax on excess calori consumpt is that in practic such a tax would have to be impos on food item rather than on nutrient energi direct as food item typic contain a group of differ nutrient a tax on a food item rather than on a nutrit compon could bring about undesir sideeffect guo et al 1999 for instanc found that higher pork price in china may inde help reduc the intak of energi and satur fatti acid of rich consum but may caus an undesir fall in protein consumpt by the poor a look at excess bodi weight and dietari energi suppli des level across countri seem to confirm the describ impact of a food tax on overweight and obes the left pane of figur 6 depict the des level and male overweight1213 in those countri for which oecd and the intern obes task forc iotf provid inform it may help to illustr a number of differ issu that character the relationship between dietari energi suppli and excess bodi weight across differ popul first it suggest that a consider overweightobes problem can exist even where food suppli level are low on averag second the preval of excess bodi weight increas with the averag food avail third onc the des exceed a certain level about 3 300 kcalspersonday there is no more increas in the preval of overweight in fact if obes estim were includ the curv would be flatter the latter reflect the fact that a larg share of calori abov 3 300 calori is like to be wast all in all the relationship between food avail and excess bodi weight resembl a typic function agricultur product function diminish product increment per unit of addit applic of an input eg fertil beyond a certain level the tax on fat food input in the context of an function help to illustr the possibl impact of a chang in input price tax on fat food on the level of output excess bodi weight the right pane of figur 6 combin the impact of a tax on excess food energi intak in the input market with the like effect on the output market excess bodi weight it underlin that the small impact of the tax on actual food avail are even further reduc as the tax is effect in the flat part of the food energybodi weight curv the flat part of the curv reflect the fact that a high des is associ with high level of wast societi with more than 3 300 kcal also wast a lot more food and may thus not experi such a rapid increas in the preval of excess bodi weight wast is in fact usual the most elast form of util and may therefor be the first to be reduc when price rise through tax again this buffer is like to be more less pronounc where incom and food avail are high low as des level climb abov the 3 300 kcal threshold the largest part of the increment food avail is like to be wast this mean that a tax on excess calori consumpt eg on calorierich food may primarili reduc the level of wast in rich countriesfor rich consum while it may affect more direct the poorer consum with lower wast level in the worst case elast poor and inelast rich consum and larg incom dispar a tax on food may do littl about obes and increas undernourish in the best case high level of equal low food demand respons it will have a small impact on obes reduc wast to a certain extent and be an effect mean to collect money that could be use to financ programm for nutrit educ 12 male overweight was chosen becaus of the larger sampl size which also includ lowincom countri 13 a look at the preval of excess bodi weight across differ incom strata within a countri would have been prefer but was in the absenc of data imposs as shown abov the link between calori avail and excess bodi weight of figur 6 is base on a crosscountri intercountri analysi of avail data it was also mention that an intracountri analysi of excess bodi weight would have been prefer but had to be dismiss becaus of a lack of incomestratifi obes data the problem with the crosscountri data is that it may not be repres of the obes distribut within a countri in fact there is grow evid that within rich countri excess bodi weight is increas a problem for poorer consum who reli heavili on the cheap but empti calori of the fast food industri nestl 2003 for instanc claim that obes is increas becom a problem of the poor who are disproportion high consum of cheap dietari energi in this case a tax on certain energyrich food item junk food could in fact have a curb impact on consumpt the problem is of cours whether poor consum in develop countri have altern that they could resort to in the case of an extra tax on such food item nevertheless the disadvantag of food price intervent are like to outweigh their advantag in reduc or revers the trend toward a higher preval of obes for rich consum inelast demand will limit the desir impact on food demand while for poor consum high price may creat an ad food insecur problem that said target price intervent at the consum level can have an impact on food consumpt pattern if i they are target ii demand is reason elast and iii consum have a choic to shift to healthier food where market and process cost are high and tax are appli to the final consum good the tax revenu could be consider the impact on primari agricultur would be small and thus the trade distort would be minim where process margin are small and demand is elast tax revenu would be small and the risk of creat advers impact on food secur could be consider 3 a tax on excess bodi weight tax on fat peopl the low effect and effici of a tax on energydens food in reduc excess bodi weight in affluent societi it potenti for creat ad trade problem and the risk of increas food insecur in poor societi or poor segment of rich societi pose the question of a more effect altern one of the most frequent discuss option is a tax on excess bodi weight rather than on excess calori consumpt colloqui this propos is be refer to as a tax on fat peopl as oppos to a tax on fat food while such a propos may sound exot at first in practic it is not in fact there are alreadi various form of incent or disincent in place that aim to reduc excess bodi weight or prevent increas in excess bodi weight howev none of these measur are refer to as a tax on fat peopl health insur polici for instanc offer discount on premium for client with normal bodi weight car insur have start to offer discount to normal weight custom as there is grow evid that obes driver have a higher risk of caus an accid even fast food chain introduc implicit tax on overweight peopl by reject obes job applic greenhous 2003 on the incent side employ offer free access to gym to their employe even dure work hour as there is ampl evid that excess bodi weight reduc the product of their staff and increas disabl and sick leav claim figur 7 in the unit state probabl the most import incent to reduc excess bodi weight was brought about by a new polici of the intern revenu servic ir 2002 state that obes is medic accept to be a diseas in it own right for taxpay this now mean that treatment specif for obes can be claim as a medic tax uction14 the basic case for these measur rest on the social cost that overweight peopl caus for societi figur 7 to the extent that obes creat extern cost for societi a tax on fat peopl could be perceiv as a pigouvian tax that help bring privat cost low premium and low percept of person health damag in line with the social cost for societi ie higher health expenditur lower product or more disabl claim to the extent that obes is a question of nurtur rather than natur such a tax would essenti reflect the applic of the pollut pay principl for obes the crucial question for practic polici implement are i whether such a tax on the output excess bodi weight would be more effici and more effect than a tax on the input excess food consumpt ii what differenti impact such measur would have on rich and poor consum food avail and food secur and iii to what extent obes is a condit caus primarili by phenotyp and genotyp predisposit or whether it is predomin the result of a food energi imbal calori intak in excess of calori expenditur there are a number of reason that suggest that a tax on excess bodi weight would be both more effect and more effici than a tax on excess food energi intak first a tax on excess food energi would address onli the calori intak side of the dietari energi imbal but leav the calori expenditur side complet unaddress when calori requir are high becaus of physic work exercis or a less effici metabol a tax on food may creat addit privat cost without creat a societ benefit on the contrari the extra food cost may reduc worker product lower their physic activ and thus creat an extra cost for societi poor consum would be hardest hit a tax on fat peopl would avoid that problem as it direct tax the result of the dietari energi imbal rather than onli the energi input side moreov a tax on excess bodi weight should not have ani trade distort impact as there is simpli no need to maintain the food tax distort through a price wedg for food at the border final to the extent to which the tax on excess bodi weight lower food demand food price may actual fall and thus afford an ad advantag to poorer consum but a tax on excess bodi weight may not be without pitfal most import lower bodi weight per se are not a guarantor for a healthier diet and lifestyl in fact there is no shortag of unhealthi way

are consider differ in the effici and effect of these measur in help to reduc the preval of obes probabl the least effici and least effect measur would be an intervent at the produc price level it would also be the measur least compat with other polici object notabl freer trade while probabl more effici a tax on consum price of food may also caus undesir sideeffect notabl where incom inequ is larg and where lowincom strata react elast to chang in food price a direct tax on excess bodi weight should be the most effici and effect measur but will not be suffici on it own there is also grow evid barker 1994 that the effect of a phenotyp or genotyp predisposit can crucial affect the occurr and degre of obes moreov a high preval of obes in a given generat can be the result of a higher preval of undernourish in the parent generat and countri that undergo a rapid nutrit transit may suffer most in this case the pollut pay principl would certain not appli and could in fact repres a grossli unfair polici measur 4 integr health and nutrit programm the preced discuss suggest that there is no simpl or singl solut instead there is grow evid that it will take a combin of polici instrument to address the problem of obes and relat ncds success such an integr programm has for instanc been launch in norway and has overal yield veri posit result the detail of the programm are avail from norum 1997 without repeat the detail the correl of success were i a strong legal and institut foundat of a populationwid effort in a nation organ ie the nation nutrit council nnc ii a robust scientif and empir backing15 and iii a combin of measur from food price intervent to nationwid food educ programm embrac a great number of stakehold practic experi in norway also suggest that there can be a consider timelag between the implement of various measur and the first measur success the republ of korea provid anoth exampl of a success nutrit programm detail are avail from lee popkin and kim 2002 kim moon and popkin 2000 find that food energi intak and obes level in the republ of korea are approxim half of what might be expect in a countri at that econom level while veget intak is much higher than might be expect lee popkin and kim 2002 suggest that a number of factor have contribut to this outcom first there has been a strong movement to retain tradit diet and food prepar at the heart of this movement is a train programm which has been offer by the rural develop administr sinc the 1980s the home manag divis of the rural live scienc institut suwon republ of korea has train thousand of extens worker to provid month train session in cook method for tradit korean food such as rice kimchi pickl and ferment cabbag and ferment soybean product the programm appear to reach a signific compon of the newli marri women in the republ of korea but exact statist are not avail at least to a certain extent food consumpt was also curb by higher food price which were back by domest produc price support and border measur the same combin of food tradit educ programm and higher food price may help to explain the posit nutrit outcom in japan where as in norway and the republ of korea the preval of obes and ncds remain much lower than in other countri of compar develop and incom level see figur 1 5 summari and conclus this paper has analys some of the current discuss polici option to reduc or avoid foodrel caus of excess bodi weight and ncds the analysi includ various option from food price intervent at various level to integr nutrit programm intervent at the produc price level have been identifi as the least effici and the least effect in chang nutrit outcom and reduc excess bodi weight they are also unlik to be compat with effort to liber agricultur trade consum price intervent are like to be more effici at least in develop countri particular as their effect are not dilut by huge process margin but what plagu all price intervent is the fact that those consum who should reduc excess energi intak are like to be the least respons to price increas and will thus not alter their consumpt pattern onli becaus food is more expens ala the opposit hold for poor countri or poor consum in rich countri where higher food cost could bring about or aggrav undernourish problem probabl more effect and effici than a tax on food would be a direct tax on excess bodi weight ie a tax on obes itself in fact mani develop countri have alreadi institut such tax most in the form of penalti for extra bodi weight or incent premiumstax brake to lose excess bodi weight the main advantag are i no negat sideeffect on food market ii compat with other polici measur and iii no penalti for consum who need highenergi intak level becaus of a higher calori expenditur moreov the tax would not onli have fewer sideeffect but be more effect and effici as it address the excess bodi weight 15 for exampl the oslo studi or the health survey of the nation health screen servic problem from both side of the energi balanc the calori intak side and the calori expenditur side the main drawback are possibl difficulti in the actual implement and the fact that a lower bodi weight in itself is no guarantor for a healthier diet the discuss of the various price intervent mechan also underlin that there is no singl measur that is suffici to address the problem where progress toward a healthier diet and in the sequel a healthier popul has becom realiti the under polici chang includ a broad spectrum of measur these measur encompass not onli price intervent and

of intern and public affair at columbia univers of new york which address a central debat in polici develop and environment econom the potenti for link carbon sequestr through land use chang to poverti allevi the purpos of the project is twofold to develop a methodolog which can be wide appli in estim potenti suppli respons to environment servic payment among the poor and to provid an empir estim of what this respons would be in costa rica research goal includ assess of the degre to which poverti influenc land use chang decis specif deforest and what implic this has for establish a carbon emiss baselin as well as the potenti suppli of carbon under a payment program furthermor the project seek to determin the degre to which payment for sequestr servic could be a potenti instrument for poverti allevi costa rica was select for studi becaus it is the site of an ongo research effort to estim potenti carbon offset suppli from land use by an interdisciplinari team of research led by alex pfaff at the columbia univers and therefor much of the necessari data were alreadi avail howev other featur of the countri also contribut toward make costa rica an ideal set for our analysi land use and the popul composit of the countri have gone through dramat transform sinc the 1960s costa rica suffer a massiv loss of forest cover sinc the 1960s with peak in the 70s bixbi and palloni 1996 but experienc also a notabl reduct of poverti in the last decad main due to the structur adjust process initi in mid1980 and to invest in educ world bank 1997 in their work on estim the potenti for carbon offset suppli from land use chang the pfaff team construct a dynam model of land use decis make to predict forest clear behavior the data set use in their studi consist of observ of forest cover for costa rica over five point in time2 pfaff et al 2003 in this three chapter studi we are interest in estim the degre to which poor peopl would respond to carbon payment and thus the degre to which such payment may contribut to poverti allevi to accomplish this use the methodolog develop by pfaff et al 2003 we need a measur of poverti at a compat level of analysi in order to distinguish the respons to payment among rich and poor in recent year new techniqu for deriv subnat level measur of poverti have been develop these are refer to as poverti map techniqu the primari purpos of poverti map is the spatial identif of the poor which also allow us to creat 1 we would like to thank alberto zezza for detail comment and irini maltsoglou pierr vauthier dimitra zarra federico castillo juan robalino and oswaldo segura for their help in obtain and set up the census data 1963 1979 1986 1997 2000 2 2 variabl that can be use in statist analys in which poverti is a depend or explanatori variabl the latter is our primari motiv in conduct the analysi present in this chapter to accomplish this object we deriv a spatial explicit nation disaggreg measur of poverti over time which can be use as an explanatori variabl in the multivari analysi of land use chang to assess the impact of poverti on deforest and ultim the potenti suppli of carbon from the poor under a carbon offset payment program the construct of a time variant poverti map repres a methodolog innov while the build of poverti map has gain increas interest among develop practition and polici maker most method concentr on map of a singl moment in time time seri spatial explicit data are relat difficult to come by constrain the degre to which poverti map over time can be develop in addit account for chang in spatial group over time creat complic in the analysi as we demonstr in this chapter differ methodolog are avail for the construct of poverti map see davi 2003 henning 2002 and snel and henning 2002 for review of altern methodolog in the present research the choic of a povertymap indic was constrain by time budget access to data as well as research object the project requir a techniqu that was inexpens and relat quick to construct did not requir travel to costa rica was base on exist and access data and could be use as an explanatori variabl in a multivari framework the techniqu also need to be compar over time as the analyt strategi involv time seri one observ per decad multivari regress this paper first discuss the two candid method we consid for the construct of the poverti map over time and provid the reason whi we chose the princip compon method next we describ the estim of the princip compon method both at one point in time 1973 and over time as well as the result poverti map we compar the result of the poverti map use various techniqu and base dataset and conclud with a discuss on the relat merit of the various option avail ii choos a method two method were consid in order to disaggreg poverti by district for four decad princip compon analysi and communitylevel small area estim princip compon princip compon is a type of factor analysi base on a statist techniqu for reduc a given number of variabl by extract a linear combin which best describ these variabl and transform them into one index this index of poverti or margin as it is often call depend on the variabl employ can provid a multidimension communitylevel poverti indic the first princip compon the linear combin captur the greatest variat among the set of variabl can be convert into factor score which serv as weight for the creation of the margin index for a nation poverti map the method requir census data at ani level of polit or geograph aggreg from the household to the state or provinci 3 level3 the desir level of disaggreg in our case is the third administr level or district after provinc and canton the poverti index is base on the formula from filmer and pritchett 1998 1 aj i1 f a n i ji ai si where fi is the factor score for asset i aji is the jth district valu for asset i and ai and si are the mean and standard deviat of asset i variabl over all district by construct the mean valu of the index is zero small area estim small area estim is a statist techniqu which combin survey and census data to estim welfar or other indic for disaggreg geograph unit such as municip or rural communiti small area estim appli paramet from a predict model to ident variabl in a census or auxiliari databas assum that the relationship defin by the model hold for the larger popul as well as from the origin sampl small area estim is current the most popular methodolog for the creation of nation poverti map two princip approach have emerg the first use household unit level data from a census has been develop princip by staff at the world bank and is the princip methodolog util and promot by the bank world bank 2000 hentschel et al 2000 and elber lanjouw and lanjouw 2001 the second use communiti level averag instead of household unit level data and has been employ by research at both the world bank and various intern agricultur research center bigman et al 2000 and minot 2000 the communitylevel small area estim method requir two set of data at a minimum census data averag at a given level and a repres household survey correspond approxim to the same time period as the census the first step is to estim a model of consumpt base household welfar use household survey data this model should be estim by statist repres region or area such as urbanrur with explanatori variabl limit to those found in both data set the second step is to appli these paramet estim to averag valu taken at the chosen level of disaggreg a predict level of averag consumpt is then obtain from the consumpt equat and from this the incid of poverti at the chosen level of disaggreg is construct see bigman et al 2000 the method of choic princip compon has been use in a number of countri the mexican govern has use princip compon for decad to creat a margin index for plan purpos more recent it has been employ as part of the target mechan of the progresa rural antipoverti program which dispens almost 2 billion to over 4 million household 4 annual the mexican applic of princip compon has been compar to a method similar to communiti level small area estim skoufia davi and de la vega 2001 while both method are high correl the communitylevel small area estim result in a stricter categor of poverti impli that the small area estim method would be more appropri if avoid leakag includ the non poor as beneficiari is more import than avoid undercoverag exclud the poor the correl between the two method tend to break down in the middl of the margin spectrum which suggest that princip compon is sharpest at high level of margin this result howev cannot be assum to be true for all context filmer and pritchett 1998 use princip compon in order to construct a household level asset index as a proxi for wealth they evalu their applic to india by compar it with other estim of state level poverti and they found a high level of correl they did find howev a systemat bias against rural wealth as compar to convent poverti measur mani of their asset variabl depend on infrastructur and thus urban household are more like to look better off then poorer household howev standard poverti measur may be bias sinc real incomesconsumpt are not adjust by these implicit price differenti filmer and pritchett also compar the asset index to consumpt data on the same household use data from nepal india and pakistan and found the measur produc similar rank overal they found the asset index as a measur of longterm wealth was more stabl and had less measur error than tradit consumpt expenditur and thus perform better as an explanatori variabl in their case in predict school enrol differ for a review of some applic of the small area estim method see davi 2003 minot and baulch 2002 look into the issu of how much precis is lost when use census data aggreg to communiti level or ani other level they conclud that while the best option is to use householdlevel data communitylevel census data can be use to generat reason accur poverti estim we choos princip compon for a number of reason first it is a cheap and relat easi method to comput onc data are obtain second it has been util in practic in a number of countri and has provid accept result third princip compon have been shown to compar favor with consumpt base measur particular as an explanatori variableproxi for long term margin or wealth in multivari analysi fourth the necessari data are avail over four decad this last element provid the key advantag over communitylevel small area estim sinc household survey data is avail onli from 1987 to 2000 link 1990s survey data to census from 1960s and 1970s would be riski consid the import chang in the costa rican economi over this period for

the dataset on deforest trend and sequestr suppli construct by pfaff et al 2003 we requir socioeconom 5 data over the same time period as their land use data set that is as mani time point possibl from at least 1963 onward the unit of measur for the poverti variabl also need to be appropri for the scale of analysi util in the land use dataset construct by pfaff et al 2003 their dataset is base upon district level inform as well as pixel level data which can be aggreg to the district level we thus select the district as the appropri scale of analysi for our poverti analysi from 1973 to 2000 census data variabl aggreg at the district level are avail electron from the centro centroamericano de census data from 1963 were not avail electron and thus were collect from general de y censo in

dataset inform on educ type of remuner depend ratio literaci and telephon servic were not avail at the district level we select a group of variabl from the census dataset which are typic associ with poverti we exclud variabl which in our judgment had no clear econom mean as well as variabl play a small role in explain the varianc such as type of job occup or hous with heat system ultim we develop a list of 17 variabl from the 1973 and later census and a smaller set of 12 variabl from the 1963 data the final list of variabl is shown in tabl 1 most of these variabl have been util and found to be

85 percent of the popul lack access to electr and 50 percent lack access to sewag facil the averag number of occup per room for the wealthiest district was 147 as compar to 405 for the poorest follow the same trend the averag number of year of educ per person is 612 in richest district and 244 in the poorest overal the poorest live in low qualiti dwell lack access to water and electr do not have a bathroom use coal or wood to cook have a lower level of educ have lower level of employ in wage labour and have a higher number of occup per room the relationship of these variabl with poverti is

a timevari measur of poverti in the previous discuss we focus on the construct of a static poverti index for one point in time use the exampl of 1973 to illustr the techniqu static indic howev are not compar over time each index is base on an eigenvector or scale which is relev onli to that particular estim in other word the unit in which the index are construct vari in each estim preclud comparison of the index among differ census year this present a problem for the regress analysi describ in the introduct which requir a poverti index compar over time to overcom this limit we pool the 1963 1973 1984 and 2000 census data and estim princip compon over the combin data the result eigenvector is than appli to the variabl valu from each census year use equat 1 the princip limit assumpt is that we have averag the impact of the includ variabl over the four decad of data we have avail chang in the margin index is thus limit to chang in the level of variabl and not chang in the relat import or impact of each variabl in determin the index for instanc chang in social or econom structur may alter the import of educ over the period 1963 to 2000 but we have essenti averag these chang over all year we face two data limit in make this estim first the number of district chang each census year over time as the popul grow district split and the overal number increas the number chang from 333 in 1963 to 406 in 1973 420 in 1984 and 459 in 2000 the second limit is the lack of avail of a complet set of 17 variabl for estim poverti in the 1963 census dataset as was discuss in section a abov below we describ how we overcam these limit overcom the first limit chang in district area over time typic new district are creat by split larger district into part in which case the origin name of the district remain with one section while the other receiv a new name we manag to obtain inform about the evolut of district from 1980 onward but not for chang that occur between 1963 to 1980 to rerun the poverti index consist with new district or district recod we essenti face two option either reaggreg data from later year back into the 1963 configur of district or disaggreg earli year data base on the 2000 district configu specif 1 reaggreg if in year t1 we have district a and b which were deriv from district a in year t we reaggreg them back into district a reaggreg mean that the valu of each variabl for district b is aggreg back with the valu of the same variabl of district a ie if we have the number of men and women of district a and b in t1 we add them togeth and have the total number of men and women in the district that now we call a as it was in year t in this way we can build our analysi on the base year which is 1973 and remain consist with the oldest district have all detail we need on variabl to use although at a more aggreg level of analysi fewer district 12 2 disaggreg district a in earlier year is divid into part consist with the district configur of later year here a in t becam a and b in t1 therefor we disaggreg a into a and b also at time t the second method disaggreg would creat chang in poverti result from chang in area there would be more district and thus more observ as a result of have this inform sinc in the earlier year aggreg valu for old district would be assign to both section of the disaggreg estim howev this could creat a serious bias in the poverti estim if in fact the disaggreg section differ signific in their incid of poverti the rich one will show declin in poverti over time and the poor one increas due to the chang in the area over which averag were calcul the first method reaggreg use the inform we have on district chang over time not to creat more district but instead to elimin the chang in poverti level that aris sole from the chang in area with this method we end up with a data set of onli those district that persist through time howev the spatial averag done in the earli year within the offici district would be the same as the spatial averag done by reaggreg the district in the later year in our estim we appli the first method reason that the gain in error reduct was more import than the loss of inform it entail we use the number of district at the earliest point in time for the analysi as the base and reaggreg all data from later year to these same district boundari thus for the estim of poverti indic by district for 19732000 we use 406 district which was the number of district in 1973 for the estim done for 19632000 we use 333 district which was the number of district in 1963 overcom the second limit differ in data avail between census year to overcom the second problem we decid to creat two differ index one which would use the full set of 17 variabl for the year it was avail 19732000 and a second index with the smaller set of 12 variabl which are avail for all time period begin in 1963 3 timevari poverti map result district level 17 variabl for 1973 1984 and

spearman rho is alway 09 similar in compar the rank provid by the three pool index over time we can confirm the valid of the methodolog at least for the better off district 1973 vs 1984 and 1984 vs 2000 whilst for the worst off district the index doe show a weak correl and this might be due to miss data for district that chang over time as explain befor iv conclus in this paper we have construct a variabl measur poverti for use as an explanatori variabl in a districtlevel multivari regress analysi the method we chose princip compon requir fair limit amount of data as compar with other method which was a major consider in our choic of princip compon the method also allow estim a poverti index compar over differ point in time although base upon the somewhat stringent assumpt of no chang in the relat import of each compon of the index over the time period consid a comparison of the result from estim base on pool versus static data indic that for this dataset the assumpt of stabil in poverti compon over time is valid this is one of the first exampl in the literatur of a timevari poverti index we also address the issu of chang in administr unit over time which is like to be a common problem in ani time variant spatial analysi we argu for the use of a reaggreg procedur where the number and boundari of district at the earliest point in time for the analysi is use as the base to which all subsequ unit are reaggreg in this analysi the 21 the gain in error reduct was more import than the loss of inform it entail although in other situat the opposit may hold true we estim two set of poverti indic over time at the district level for costa rica one base upon a set of variabl and district configur from 1963 and the second base upon variabl and district configur from 1973 we found that there is consider similar in the result between the two base year estim in term of poverti rank in both case the princip compon analysi yield a first princip compon which explain approxim 64 percent of the variat in the data we also found the direct of the sign of the factor deriv from the eigenvector the same for the set of variabl includ in each of the base year estim and that the relat impact of the includ variabl remain fair consist between the two estim the result of the poverti map are broad consist with other studi of poverti in costa rica final our result indic the import of scale and locat in the analysi of poverti we found that over the time period from 1973 to 2000 the wealthiest and poorest district were consist locat in the same provinc although there was variat in which district these were thus at a provinci level poverti and wealth are spatial cluster in costa rica over time and the effect is quit strong at a district level of analysi howev although we still do find pattern of spatial cluster particular at the relat extrem of wealth and poverti we are also abl to see much more heterogen in the distribut of wealth over time these result do indic that

equip season 1200304 1 nguyen van thuong phan thanh binh keith chapman anthoni marsh summari wet coffe process equip trial conduct in 200304 found that the cost of mash or split fresh coffe rang from 52 vndkg to 332 vndkg green bean equival depend on size qualiti and sophist of mash machin this cost is quit small when compar to farm gate price for green bean which rang between 9000 to 14000 vndkg mash split can slight increas the speed of dri but this process can also result in mould qualiti and ota problem as well as physic damag to the bean dri in the mash of skin and parchment the trial also found that coffe pulper and demucilag use with solar dri technolog may be benefici to the viet nam coffe industri pulper and demucilag which pulp and separ skin and then remov the mucilag have been demonstr to cost between 3322 vndkg and 1701 vndkg green bean equival while this is substanti more than the cost of mash split there are substanti save to be made in dri as half of the total moistur of the cherri has been remov in the skin and the mucilag dri effici of each squar meter of dri area can increas by over 100 after pulp and demucilag ad to this are the benefit of higher qualiti coffe and less chanc of contamin from mould and ota introduct one of main reason for poor coffe qualiti is mould and the possibl ota generat occur dure the dri stage of the coffe process slow and uneven dri and rewet will result in mould generat and qualiti problem in viet nam limit dri patio area contribut to this slow dri as coffe is stack too deepli on dri patio the separ of the coffe pulp and mucilag layer from parchment coffe both arabica and robusta befor dri will substanti reduc the time requir for dri in the past this was consid an expens and impract method as suitabl

summari an elevenmonth coffe storag trial was conduct at boun me thout viet nam where nine type of robusta coffe were store in a ventil store on pallet and in an unventil store direct on the concret floor this paper report on qualiti aspect of the store coffe part i part ii the follow paper detail fungal aspect of the same storag trial month averag temperatur and air humid in both the seal store and the natur ventil store were similar howev moistur content of coffe in the seal store was alway higher than in the ventil store the main reason for this is that the coffe in direct contact with the cement absorb moistur from the floor and not from the air qualiti of coffe bean held in polypropylen bag in the ventil store was found to be better than coffe on the concret floor in the seal store in the seal store coffe was serious degrad after 6 month of storag after 11 month of storag in the seal store the moistur content of coffe and mould increas and the coffe was of unaccept qualiti coffe in the ventil store was still accept after 11 month of storag it was also found that qualiti did not degrad as quick if coffe was store as dri cherri and parchment coffe rather than green bean coffe

the vent store decreas from the ninemonth high valu this occur in the dri season januari 2005 where the air humid was lower which result in coffe bean lose moistur in the natur ventil store general throughout the trial moistur in all coffe in the seal store was higher than those in the vent store the same coffe materi react differ in each of the two store it was note that in the seal store the coffe direct pile on the cement floor absorb moistur from the ground surfac consequ the moistur of coffe bean in the seal store increas more rapid than that in the natur ventil store where coffe was stack on pallet and not in contact with the floor there were clear differ in the moistur of the nine lot of coffe in the same store chang in moistur of coffe bean from parchment coffe befor storag in the two store are illustr in graph 1 tabl 1 clear show the chang in coffe bean moistur content by month in the two store moistur of bean gradual increas dure the raini season from may to octob 2004 in both type of store and it seem to increas more slowli from novemb to decemb 2004 howev moistur of coffe in the seal store continu to increas up to februari 2005 moistur of coffe bean of differ lot in the seal store increas over 20 graph 2 while moistur content of coffe in the vent store decreas rang from 134 to 148 graph 3 when compar the graph 2 and graph 3 it can be seen that there were small differ in moistur content between parchment coffe green coffe mash coffe and coffe cherri in each type of store air temperatur and relat humid in the store at ani given temperatur coffe bean may absorb moistur from the air or lose moistur into the air becaus there is a differ between water potenti in the bean and air water potenti the relat humid rh at which a heap of coffe bean will not absorb moistur or lose moistur indic a state here a balanc between loss and absorpt of water from the mass of bean has been reach this state is call equilibrium relat humid erh at air rh abov 65 coffe bean will absorb water from the air at air rh below 65 coffe bean will slowli lose water to the air graph 4 5 and 6 illustr condit of air temperatur and humid in the seal and vent store general temperatur and the humid in the seal store were alway higher than those in the vent store compar the chang in the air temperatur and humid in the two 36 store refer to tabl 19 and tabl 20 it can be seen that temperatur in the seal store in the sunni and hot month such as april may decemb 2004 and januari 2005 was onli higher than that in the vent store in the wet season the differ of temperatur in the two store was small howev in the dri month in the seal store air humid was about 5 lower than that in the vent store in the raini season the differ in humid in the two store was small henc air humid in the seal store was not the key factor that increas moistur in coffe bean coffe bean in heap on the cement floor rapid absorb moistur from the floor result in a larg increas of bean moistur content after 11 month of storag and serious degrad of coffe in summari except for april 2004 and part of may 2004 the condit in the store at boun me thout are all abov an rh of 65 thus coffe can

method common use to reduc coffe bean moistur content to the requir level of 12 open air sun dri mechan dri solar dri open air sun dri and mechan dri are popular method in mani coffe product countri in the world solar dri method are not wide use as they are often more cost and complex to construct and manag dri durat depend on mani factor such as temperatur humid and thick of materi layer solar dryer sd can make more effici use of sun energi concentr heat and avoid the risk of coffe be rewet it is therefor expect that solar dri will enabl coffe to dri faster the sd system also allow the use of fan or air ventil to speed up the coffe dri the type of coffe use for dri is also a factor in the dri speed it is assum that mashedpulp and mucilageremov coffe need less time to be dri than cherri

temperatur reduc and rh increas see graph 2 similar result were obtain through observ of daili temperatur and relat humid develop in trial 2 see graph 3 and 4 discuss normal the higher the dri temperatur and the lower the rh the shorter the dri process high air temperatur in close fvsds made temperatur of bean bulk increas consider but high relat humid fvsd appear to decreas the dri speed as moist air was not move away from the coffe in addit high temperatur togeth with high humid in fvsd promot the ferment of coffe cherrybean and affect the qualiti of final product it is difficult to control the relationship between temperatur and relat humid to keep temperatur high but relat humid low it is expect that the use of fan ventil in fvsds help to reduc relat humid after each fan ventil the temperatur and relat humid in fvsds vari consider tabl 3 show that the temperatur and relat humid in fvsd reduc each time after fan ventil relat humid and temperatur vari most in the period from 0900 to 1500hr at 1700hr the air ventil seem to have no posit impact it appear to increas the relat humid in sd by 2 this is explain as follow at 0900hr to 1100hr due to the impact of greenhous effect heat accumul made temperatur in sds increas higher than outsid temperatur the fan ventil help to reduc temperatur in sds at 1700hr the outsid temperatur reduc while the relat humid increas therefor ventil carri out at 1700hr of later will draw moist cool air into the sds caus an increas of the humid in sds it is therefor recommend not to ventil the fvsd after 1700hr at 0700 the first fan ventil of the day has posit impact as it reduc the relat humid in sd by 53 this is probabl becaus the air temperatur reduc and rh in sd increas over night becaus it is seal condens was found insid plastic

rate of the studi and is also low in ochr infect it show slight more ota posit sampl with the same mean and maximum but these number are veri uncertain given that they are low and subject to the

as his biggest problem in ani area of his work whether plant pest and diseas horticultur issu manag or financi problem the main process method is the dri method so dri is the most problemat and decis factor for the success of process procedur farmer general do not have mechan dri so reli on sundri harvest octob to januari begin in most place dure the last month of raini season and this caus problem at the dri yard and consequ problem of coffe qualiti dri surfac area is too small for the volum of coffe at peak of harvest typic there is insuffici labour avail dure the harvest period coffe steal from the orchard is a problem and this induc farmer to harvest too earli bring in green cherri 95 conclus a farm situat averag area of farm is 21 ha in which 2 ha are for coffe this prove that coffe farmer have special to grow coffe and are depend on the coffe sector economi for their welfar most farmer do not live at the farm becaus it is often far from popul centr in area lack infrastructur such as school electr and hospit high yield averag 325 mts green coffeeha prove that farmer invest and cultiv skill are both veri high fresh coffe cherri is brought to farmer hous or dri yard daili and process is conduct by the farmer b harvest situat coffe is harvest 25 time crop labour suppli for harvest is report to be insuffici select pick ripe cherri is carri out onli at the begin of crop harvest 115 product later harvest is by strip pick amount to 885 of product the rate of green cherri is quit high at an averag of 30 accord to the viet nam standard 10 tcvn9588 standard of viet nam coffe industri this kind of raw coffe is rate grade 4 lowest grade if excess green cherri is harvest this reduc the yield and also produc an uneven moistur distribut in the bulk coffe these bean retain high moistur after hull and often becom mouldi c process situat harvest coffe cherri is never clean or sort eg into immatur dri ripe befor dri foreign matter in the dri layer might be expect to caus extra microbi contamin there is no price incent to expend more effort dure process despit it be known that coffe qualiti is affect by these cherri characterist delay dri after harvest in sack and heap for excess period is widespread the guidelin is for a delay of a maximum of 2 day but approxim 50 of farmer averag 74 day delay this caus heat and ferment mouldi tast there is everi indic that dri yard provis is inadequ for the yield of coffe and this may explain the excess delay befor dri about 80 of the vn coffe is dri as whole cherri the balanc be pulp or split cherri dri period of the splitpulp cherri is report to be much shorter than whole cherri but the frequenc of damag and darken bean is often high the pulp machin also produc a mixtur of form of coffe such as split cherri whole cherri bean in parchment nake bean and pulp and this caus a product with uneven moistur content the splitpulp coffe is also more suscept than whole cherri to damag by poor weather and if dri mechan the expos bean can becom black it is note that mould still develop in the coffe mass where there are wetter bean such as immatur cherri even in good dri weather the pattern of mould infect and ota presenc in the differ region is rather uniform although process condit particular between krong buk and krong puk vari great this is not reflect in the measur made of fungal develop 96

paramet for whole cherri reveal by the survey are not accept our survey carri out in 1990s found that dri 22 kgsm2 on concret surfac requir 25 to 30 day to reduc mc to 12 or less it is like that coffe

than expect in some area up to 30 of farmer were use the practic there is evid to suggest that the practic of mash fresh cherri result in lower qualiti coffe due to physic bean damag and a higher

practic and discuss step taken to improv the qualiti and safeti of the product on sale an account of this visit is publish as annex 11 2 conclus and recommend andrew w shepherd n rome jeanjoseph cadilhon nrap bangkok conclus there are mani way in which qualiti and safeti of fresh produc can be negat affect rang from the soil use to cultiv the crop to the handl by consum and retail at the time of sale at the product level soil can contain excess heavi metal while water use for irrig and for wash harvest produc can be and frequent is pollut the choic of varieti can affect the attract of a product to consum and can also have an impact on the shelf life of the product use of untreat manur can spread pathogen harvest practic can have a major impact on both qualiti and safeti with fruit and veget often be harvest immatur too soon after pesticid applic or at the wrong time of the day diseas and pest are widespread and can have a major impact on qualiti howev counter such problem by use pesticid has major implic for food safeti particular when they are not appli in accord with recommend or when ban chemic continu to be use problem relat to qualiti and safeti do not howev stop at the farm poor packag and the tendenc to squeez too much produc into a contain or vehicl can have a signific impact on qualiti exposur to the element while await transport can reduc qualiti as can poor handl dirti packag materi and dirti vehicl can introduc physic and microbi contamin as can wash dure market or the water of leafi veget use dirti water poor storag practic may damag produc and reduc it shelf life chemic use for ripen and for surfac decontamin often not recommend for that purpos can affect safeti of fruit and veget as can the use of some wax colour agent and insecticid appli dure the market process market infrastructur is often inadequ and unhygien produc is frequent expos to ambient condit and store trim and sold while place on bare earth final produc qualiti can be serious affect by the practic of allow consum to pick their own fruit and veget from a retail display and microbi contamin can also result from this sever countri have qualiti standard for fruit and veget but these are usual voluntari and not appli by market channel which set their own standard normal on the basi of size grade all countri have pesticid legisl and agenc respons for regist and control the use of agrochem howev in mani countri enforc remain inadequ control appear to be larg ineffect due to poor coordin between the agenc involv with food safeti and qualiti and those charg with control pesticid use and other aspect of product combin with a lack of resourc and a general lack of complianc with law and regul which make enforc of regul next to imposs mani countri report signific ill and death result from consumpt of 3 fruit and veget contamin with either microb or pesticid residu and these report possibl underst the true pictur local agenc are general illequip to monitor microbi contamin and littl advic appear to be avail for farmer and trader about way of avoid such contamin farmer rare undertak action to improv qualiti or safeti factor explain this are marketrel socioeconom and awarenessrel for mani consum in asia price is seen as the most import factor influenc a purchas decis follow by the locat of the retail there is a reluct to pay more for qualiti and a general lack of awar of safeti issu where there is a percept of qualiti it is larg relat to the physic appear of the produc with the result that trader put pressur on farmer to produc blemishfre fruit and veget which may involv use larg amount of pesticid increas demand for fruit and veget togeth with land and labour shortag has led to intensif involv higher level of pesticid use as has the grow demand for outofseason product although trader do reject produc as unaccept fruit and veget meet minimum standard are general purchas at the same price regardless of qualiti or safeti characterist farmer thus have no incent to improv qualiti beyond the minimum necessari to make a sale there may be a disincent to reduc pesticid usag if as a consequ fruit and veget becom blemish and fail to meet minimum standard unreli market channel and uncertainti about the price similar discourag invest market channel practic such as buy the field or orchard or provid financ to farmer in advanc of the harvest may also have implic for produc qualiti seek to maxim their incom farmer often sell unrip produc in order to take advantag of higher price where market channel are unreli farmer may sell immatur produc becaus they cannot be sure that a trader will be buy when the produc is readi riskavers farmer frequent believ that reduc use of pesticid would signific reduc their yield in some countri this propens to use agrochem is enhanc by polici that exempt pesticid from tax or duti or by credit programm that includ the cost of pesticid as part of a loan packag ban chemic continu to be use in part becaus farmer are unawar that they are illeg but also becaus they are cheaper concern to maxim incom often lead farmer to sell produc that has onli recent been spray ignor recommend preharvest interv use of pesticid is also promot by social pressur no farmer want to be seen as the caus of a local infest overus and misus is promot by some agrochem retail often the onli sourc of inform avail to farmer and by illiter farmer not know when to appli pesticid and be unawar of the correct product or dose knowledg at farm level of factor contribut to microbi contamin is neglig trader seek to improv produc qualiti are constrain by the purchas power of consum in general consum make qualiti choic within an afford price rang limit survey indic a willing to pay slight more for safe food but the premium consum are will to pay may not compens for the higher product cost amongst the middl class there is an increas demand for better qualiti and safeti but tradit market channel face problem in suppli such 4 demand as they seem to have limit capac to handl more than one qualiti grade of a particular fruit or veget some sort of produc doe take place in market channel but this is usual on the basi of

was indic that this is possibl in certain sector as in the case of pesticid residu test facil that can serv as an incomegener project the action plan on creat consum awar was question sinc consum cannot identifi whether the produc is safe furthermor if consum buy from the tradit market how can they be assur that the produc is safe accord assur of safeti should start with the grower and all throughout the market chain while extern sign of safeti are not appar consum need to be inform that safe produc is avail it was suggest that consum can be made awar through label it was also suggest

of wto there has been an increas consum awar or conscious this is the base scenario that can be work on toward 2015 scenario 2 some produc and tradit trader make necessari invest to switch to suppli the modern distribut sector but sever becom trap becaus they becom depend on their design custom or cannot sell their produc to the tradit market at a satisfactori price the remain produc stay in the situat describ in scenario 1 this scenario was judg to be possibl and accept for the follow reason this best describ the real situat all the reason in scenario 1 are applic a major of farmer are still under scenario 1 although there have been improv contract farm provid more link between consum and farmer there has been an increas in the number of farmer group organ and cluster trade associ and farmeragroprocessor group at the farm level some produc have invest to captur new market dysfunct aspect of the tradit market system are address eg long market chain high market cost low return to

them to produc bigger quantiti of differenti product for differ and clear identifi custom their enlarg size enabl them to gain negoti power and improv their produc qualiti this was consid an imposs scenario becaus of the follow reason it is veri ambiti it doe not reflect the situat in the major of asian countri it repres develop countri like taiwan provinc of china japan and the republ of korea where farm are big and have good financ capabl 35 envisag scenario the chosen scenario that was possibl and most desir was scenario 2 with one slight modif as follow some produc and tradit trader make necessari invest to switch to suppli the modern distribut sector but sever becom trap becaus they becom depend on their design custom or cannot sell their produc to the tradit market at a satisfactori price howev the major of produc stay in the situat describ in scenario 1 the action plan were categor in three level farmer trader and governmentth action plan would respond to the follow object 1 to

becom gapcertifi this was seen as a way of complement the good practic implement by certifi farmer this was support by the comment that it is easier to introduc innov through the trader regard the question on invest in facil mani share the view that this should be done by the privat sector with the govern act as a facilit by provid incent such as tax benefit group iii stakehold capac build propos scenario scenario 1 extens worker trader and produc have limit fund and limit technic capabl to improv food qualiti and safeti this was judg a possibl scenario becaus it alreadi exist general situat alreadi mention in previous present howev it was an undesir scenario becaus there would be no develop from the current situat 36 scenario 2 some innov trader and modern distributor take action to improv qualiti and safeti in their privat suppli chain for a specif consum segment such innov stay confidenti this was seen as a possibl scenario becaus it alreadi exist nonetheless it was judg

safeti of fresh produc at the same time trader do not organ farmer to produc safe fruit and veget it is expect that if consum demand for safe produc increas supplier will follow the market opportun financi cost for safer and higher qualiti produc if farmer and trader tri to suppli safer and higher qualiti fruit and veget consum need to pay a higher price howev if the price of safe and highqual produc is high in the market low socioeconom consum cannot afford it infrastructur constraint in order to have better qualiti and safer produc infrastructur such as cold storag and refriger better transport facil and laboratori facil to test for pesticid residu are requir at present there are no cold storag facil in urban wholesal market thus fresh produc suppli from the main surplusproduc area is sold within one or two day farmer knowledg of good agricultur practic from the viewpoint of farmer yield increas market price increas and reduct of product cost are import to increas profit margin some resourcepoor farmer use ban pesticid which are cheaper compar with legal pesticid a few farmer follow good agricultur practic gap but most are not fulli awar of pesticid residu issu some farmer use mixtur of pesticid although the dosag may be subleth initi mix sever chemic may doubl the concentr of noxious compon even if the extens servic organ tomato farmer to use a new and safer pesticid onli a few innov farmer adopt it in the main produc area due to a sharp rise in price some farmer do not follow gap and sell their tomato immedi after pesticid applic to increas yield farmer often use unprocess organ manur and are not awar of the potenti for biolog contamin of produc if trader labour and transport do not correct manag produc suppli by farmer highqual and safe produc cannot reach consum thus present transport practic need to be improv highland tomato are normal pack in wooden crate and sent to urban wholesal market by truck tight stack pattern restrict the movement of air between and through wooden crate at time transport put the wooden crate with tomato as a base into the truck and load cabbag and cauliflow on the top thus increas damag to the fragil tomato the awar and sensit of food safeti consum are not awar of food safeti base on survey result consum choic of fresh produc is high relat to size shape matur blemish bruis and fresh 64 with the except of supermarket wholesal and retail market have no cold storag facil thus fresh is an import qualiti for consum about 92 percent of consum in the survey would not purchas tomato if they were awar that pesticid residu were excess howev threefifth of yangon consum interview were not awar of pesticid residu be a problem onli a few consum purchas fresh produc in supermarket instead of retail market daili sale volum of fruit and veget in supermarket are veri low compar with retail market normal the price of fresh produc in supermarket is higher than the sell price in retail market all consum interview in supermarket of yangon citi knew that price in supermarket are high compar with retail market howev they purchas tomato and other veget in supermarket due to handl be perceiv as more hygien general speak consum cannot decid which fresh produc is safe to purchas from their viewpoint the most import thing is that the price of safe fresh produc need to be reason to find out consum opinion of price to be paid for safe fresh produc a survey was conduct in yangon retail market and supermarket the survey result were about 68 percent of consum in the sampl respond that if safe and higherqu tomato is highpric they cannot afford it for daili consumpt about 90 percent of consum in the sampl agre that consumpt of safe produc is high relat to health concern and safer produc is requir socioeconom factor affect food suppli some resourcepoor farmer use illeg pesticid in addit after sell the first harvest tomato farmer have sale revenu which they use to purchas addit pesticid due to a sharp rise in price some farmer sell green matur tomato mix with immatur tomato thus trader use ripen agent which limit the shelf life general speak mani consum in urban area do not have refriger consum behaviour depend on their need for exampl overrip tomato are select for cook today and semirip tomato are chosen for eat later the reason is that semirip tomato are store at ambient temperatur food safeti and the role of govern the consumpt of unsaf food can damag public health which can increas the cost of medic care thus the govern has a crucial role in ensur that food doe not endang consum health through chemic biolog and other contamin in order to have safe fresh produc a varieti of measur such as law regul and standard and a system of effect inspect and laboratori analysi are still need in myanmar 65 case studi of highland produc of tomato tomato is demand by consum yearround and is consum as salad soup sauc and jam it is avail throughout the year on the local market in the raini season2 when there is no lowland product larg quantiti are main suppli from southern shan state locat in the hilli region consum in lowland area reli on the market volum of highland produc in the cool season lowland area produc more than the highland thus the price of lowland produc is cheaper compar with highland produc case studi area inl lake3 in southern shan state is the main surplusproduc area there tomato is produc on float farm on the lake the area plant under tomato in 2005 is estim at 2 173 hectar tomato farmer in inl lake have farm vari in size from 336

cost of product among tomato farmer product cost variabl cost vari depend on differ level of fertil pesticid and fungicid use at the time of the survey 50 percent of cash cost for product were use on agroinput agrochem constitut 40 percent of total agroinput cost ban pesticid even though tomato farmer are awar that monocrotopho is a ban pesticid it continu to be use by about 50 percent of farmer interview the reason is that it is cheaper compar with legal pesticid at the time of survey the price of monocrotopho was 500 kyat per 100 cc while legal pesticid rang from 1 200 to 3 500 kyat per 100 cc pesticid applic general speak tomato farmer do not observ the econom threshold level and prefer more frequent applic as they are afraid of crop loss and reduct in yield about 83 percent of farmer in the sampl spray pesticid whether pest attack or not in addit farmer are not awar of the minimum time differ between the final spray of pesticid and harvest about 63 percent of farmer interview admit to sell tomato immedi after pesticid treatment due to a sharp rise in price and strong demand of local wholesal the raini monsoon season last from midmay to midoctob and the cool season from midoctob to midfebruari 3 it is locat about 900 meter abov sealevel and is 145 km long from south to north and 56 km long from east to west encyclopedia myanmar languag it is famous for both special

wait 7 to 10 day and select full red and yellow ting colour from store quantiti to be pack in wooden crate after that timber plank are use as cover and labour nail the lid on the wooden crate at time this lead to damag dure pack local wholesal endeavour to increas their suppli when quantiti of tomato demand by urban market increas thus a ripen agent is use yangon wholesal report that chemicallyripen tomato are not better for longdist transport the reason is that the fruit becom soft and has veri limit shelf life thus use a ripen agent caus deterior of qualiti which inevit lead to a negat profit margin for trader largescal wholesal in yangon report that they are veri keen to pay better price for tomato which are free of ripen agent tradit market channel some farmer sell tomato to agent who come to their farm by boat and some deliv direct to the local wholesal for collect of green matur tomato an agent receiv 437 kyat per kilogram from local wholesal base on their buy quantiti the market cost is taken out of his or her commiss fee truck are main use for long distanc transport to urban wholesal market in turn urban wholesal sell to retail in neighbourhood market and also consign the fruit to other urban market where there is no lowland product dure the raini season urban wholesal charg ten percent commiss on sale valu supermarket in yangon citi supermarket purchas highland tomato from largescal wholesal clean grade and repack are carri out prior to retail thus while consum may feel that produc from supermarket is safer it origin is the same as that sold through tradit market channel recommend general speak consum in myanmar consid that fresh fruit and veget are import for daili consumpt thus suppli of safe fresh produc is requir for consum to improv their health farm level farmer and grower in main surplusproduc area need to follow gap by do this farmer suppli should not exceed maximum residu limit mrls of pesticid and market fresh produc should

fresh produc should not be direct expos to the sunlight and rain to display label certifi the origin of the produc and the fact that it is free of pesticid as a transpar communic effort toward their

and qualiti issu for fruit and veget in pakistan on constraint experienc by produc and distributor and on make recommend for improv status of fresh produc qualiti and safeti the agroecolog divers found in pakistan enabl product of a wide rang of fresh produc almost yearround prompt by it demand in the domest and intern market fresh produc product in the countri has exhibit an increas trend over time current annual product is estim at 1213 million tonn with fruit 571 million tonn and veget 642 million tonn pakistan annual export of fresh produc are estim at 527 thousand tonn with a valu of us134 million the quest to satisfi market demand has prompt mani chang in product and postharvest manag practic product techniqu for improv the qualiti and safeti of fruit and veget are well known

1 chief oper offic pakistan horticultur develop and export board karachi pakistan 79 factor affect food qualiti and safeti there are a number of factor that affect food qualiti and safeti throughout the fresh produc product and market chain these are main group into the follow point which are briefli discuss below product harvest and field handl product prepar for the market packag transport and storag market wholesal and retail product the use of product input like sewerag and water contamin by industri effluent spray and raw farmyard manur all impact on food qualiti and safeti in pakistan crop protect is larg depend on the heavi use of pesticid this is due to a number of factor in particular inadequ knowledg and awar on the part of user and poor extens servic sinc the pesticid busi was privat in 1980 there has been a steadi increas in pesticid import and consumpt in the countri at present pakistan is consid the second largest pesticid consum countri among the twelv asia and pacif region countri this is caus serious implic for food qualiti and safeti it is estim that of the total pesticid use in pakistan 17 percent are use on fruit and veget the data reveal that out of total pesticid use in balochistan provinc of pakistan which is famous for temper fruit product as much as 90 percent is use on fruit and veget this percentag is reduc to 55 percent in the north western frontier provinc again temper fruit produc 48 percent in sindh and 6 percent in punjab the number of spray on veget like cabbag cauliflow and tomato often exceed the number of applic on cotton respond to market demand a limit number of farmer have adopt good agricultur practic though to a vari degre they sell produc to export who care to sourc direct from the farm and offer price premium harvest

cassava sweet potato green gram cowpea pawpaw bean banana pigeon pea bambara nut coco yam groundnut simsim pumpkin sunflow castor oil and differ type of veget some of the varieti display at the seed fair had not been list in the studi impli that there is more crop divers in the southern highland than previous thought for exampl at shinji there were three new varieti of maiz all of which are earlymatur and resist to drought there were also six local bean varieti which are character as highyield smallseed and diseaseresist howev these bean varieti are unmarket so they are use for home consumpt onli drought at malinzanga meant that sever of the crop and varieti expect were not display at the seed fair there ethnobotan as well as seed farmer display differ ethnobotan use to treat human diseas or to protect seed against storag pest ethnobotan for treat pest includ taget minuta tobacco and local herb such as lidudw lisakasaka and lidupala in the southern highland and mgonasimba neem mtumba saka nhunungu mavu lumbasi mtungulu and mutangangunyi in the central zone some farmer brought the ash of goat and cattl dung which is common use to control storag pest at one southern

local herb known as ikowo various type of storag structur were also display seed mix with ash to protect them against storag pest rlaub 7 followup the farmer and the crop divers they display were regist for followup after each seed fair throughout the seed fair the research team member record all the type of crop divers on show and this inform has been store in electron format for futur use by research farmer and other stakehold the day after each seed fair a feedback meet was held and attend by all the committe member who had particip in the preparatori meet the main object of these feedback was to review the whole seed fair to identifi what factor had led to achiev and what had led to problem in order to use the experi to guid futur plan the meet also identifi way of make seed fair more success and sustain in the futur train the experienc farmer were request to train other farmer on local technolog for control storag pest includ the use of ethnobotan expert farmer were identifi by their colleagu and interview by the studi team and it was found that they had acquir much of their knowledg through the accumul of experi their own inform experi and a sound understand of the local environ in the southern highland four expert farmer train anoth 60 farmer 32 women and 28 men on how to prepar appli and handl tradit pesticid includ goat dung and the herb teget minuta and lisakasaka the train creat much interest among the farmer and encourag them to consid adopt the technolog district extens staff were avail to answer farmer mani question on applic rate and method and to share experi from other villag where similar practic are alreadi wide use train was also provid on the product and process of oil from simsim sunflow groundnut and castor in order to promot these crop as valuabl contribut to local agrobiodivers train on the use and mainten of manual oil press was provid by an ngo that manufactur the press press were bought for both the southern highland villag and present to farmer dure the seed fair the ngo train 40 farmer and three villag leader after explain that the seed should be sundri prior to press the trainer demonstr how the machin work and how to assembl posit and oper it the oper skill taught includ feed press remov the seed cake and adjust the machin for effici oper farmer also learn how to process the extract crude oil into refin oil the seed crop use dure the train were sunflow pumpkin and sesam three train farmer were appoint to form a committe for manag the villag press the committe will be respons for maintain the press and prepar it for use by other farmer the farmer also decid that peopl who use the press should pay small fee which will be use for machin repair and mainten the ngo will be make followup visit to ensur that the press is proper use and maintain sustain of the seed fair as promot of local communiti learn seed exchang and seed sell the seed fair had vari success with one villag in the central zone misughaa achiev far more than the other there was also more share of knowledg and experi in this villag main becaus the set of the seed fair there was more conduc to discuss all the display were arrang on wellconstruct tabl in temporari hut so everyth was open and easi to see with no overlap of the sampl display it was recommend that seed fair be conduct onc a year after harvest when all the farmer have collect their produc into their backyard and have not yet use much of it farmer state that seed fair were a good way for them to find seed varieti that they had 8 lost or been look for without success rather than be held at the same site everi year seed fair could rotat among villag and ward as a way of spread their influenc further it was decid that as well as the district council villag can consult communitybas and nongovernment organ includ the dioces of central tanganyika which is alreadi oper in one of the villag to seek sponsor for seed fair in the futur in order to reduc cost seed fair could by combin with other festiv such as nanenan lesson learn the n guidelin for seed fair annex 2 are instrument in organ seed fair especi when it is a villag first experi of such an event as was the case in these four villag farmer expect the organ to be knowledg and to take a lead role particular in the introductori phase for farmer and local peopl mani farmer in and around the studi area are not awar of all the crop divers and local knowledg that exist in their communiti seed fair provid a learn platform for local peopl for exampl some farmer mention see crop varieti that they thought were extinct in their villag young peopl comment with surpris on the wide rang of varieti and technolog that exist in their local environ they were particular interest in the use of ethnobotan for the storag of cereal and legum and the process of cook oil from watermelon pumpkin and spong gourd seed a special prepar drama about seed fair and local knowledg prove to be an excel way of attract particip attent and pass on import messag farmer recommend that research produc inform leaflet on local seed manag and other practic for distribut among communiti member women farmer and their pumpkin rlaub seed fair includ display of equip for seed and food prepar and process such as tool for oil extract storag farm and decor in one villag farmer also demonstr recip use differ varieti such as local wine from both local and improv varieti of sorghum demonstr of oil extract from pumpkin seed and sunflow show what a tiresom process it is for the women who do it involv extract the seed from the fruit sundri and stonegrind the seed boil to separ the oil from the flesh and leav the product to settl farmer use the seed fair as an opportun for share experi among themselv and with younger generat and develop worker seed fair also allow farmer to exchang seed through barter and to market their product and seed some farmer especi those who were involv in the seed studi comment on other farmer lack of interest in the seed fair prior to the event some also express concern about seed fair particip display item such as potteri and local miner which they felt were out of place at a seed fair farmer emphas that more effort should be direct toward local crop landrac that thrive well in semiarid condit without forget those collect crop that are particular import dure harsh weather peopl in the villag who are knowledg about the use of ethnobotan should come forward to offer their valuabl advic regard the storag of food grain and seed 9 farmer regard the award as be the apex of the seed fair and the motiv for take part in the futur for extensionist and research the seed fair gave crop research the opportun to interact with differ type of farmer and to learn more about seed divers for mani research team member the fair were the first time that they had seen rare varieti that cannot be collect easili such as a central zone strain of sorghum whose local name is mpatapata tradit associ with certain crop and varieti can be record easili dure a seed fair and seed fair can also be use as a mean of triangul villag agrodisplay of rare sorghum and millet varieti rlaub biodivers or varieti data for exampl local varieti that are not display can be assum to be lost the research team note that more local seed than improv varieti were display at the seed fair and that much of the studi communiti crop divers and local knowledg has not yet been document the seed fair emphas the close link between agrobiodivers and ethnobotan such as neem tree leav saka and mtumba ethnobotan are becom valuabl market product for the farm communiti and farmer need support in develop the capac to process pack and label them as part of the commerci process it was interest to note that wild varieti of finger millet rice and sorghum were display these have a role to play in food secur and farmer explain their valu especi dure extrem drought when common food crop fail farmer also comment that a wide rang of collect crop green veget eg milenda wild fruit eg lade and neglect crop such as local puls eg maharag makubwa or cucurbitac are import to the food secur of farm communiti in semiarid area collect food plant rlaub in addit the seed fair demonstr that semiarid area have the potenti to produc oilse moringa cotton pumpkin sunflow spong gourd castor oil watermelon safflow and other which thrive well in these region regard the organ of futur seed fair it is import that the farmer who particip in research should take a lead role howev all other stakehold should also be involv includ policymak at differ level success seed fair requir at least a month of prepar includ sensit meet and public villag leader research farmer group and extens offic are wellplac for spread the word about 10 the come event and the exact number of farmer display should be known two day befor the seed fair dure the event itself all offici guest should be in attend throughout the whole day for exampl farmer in one villag had prepar local food and drink to share with all guest and other attende for the futur it was suggest that a receptionist be appoint to greet offici guest and provid them with name label food vendor and entertain troup should also be organ to keep the event aliv for offici seed fair are an eyeopen for policymak and politician regard the wealth of local knowledg offici guest at the seed fair show consider interest in the local biodivers and product on display and did much to draw the visit media attent to the concept behind the event dure their speech some offici undertook to promot the hold of seed fair in the futur farmer comment that such interest is encourag to them they would like to see gift and certif for futur show as well as recognit from the influenti peopl who attend them farmer particular appreci the purchas of seed ethnobotan and other valuabl materi that were made by visit offici and would like to encourag more of these in the futur in the central zone the lack of an offici close ceremoni was seen as benefici becaus onc an event has been declar close everybodi dispers discourag latecom from benefit from the fair recommend the communiti divers seed fair should be organ regular by rural communiti prefer onc per year after the main harvest period these seed fair are an excel opportun for farmer to display and exchang their local seed varieti and the relat local knowledg it is import to highlight that women farmer who are veri often seed manag specialist have easi access to this kind of seed fair dure the seed fair a cultur programm should be organ the present of song poem and theater piec attract a lot of attent also from the younger generat dure these event the particip can learn to valu and appreci the import of local agrobiodivers manag and practic for food secur the communiti divers seed fair are a good learn opportun for all the particip the seed fair should be use to bring men and women farmer togeth with extens staff and research to exchang germplasm differ crop varieti and experi moreov the seed fair offer a good occas to combin the event with participatori plant breed exercis and other mutual learn and experi opportun for the particip 11 appendic annex 1 synthesi of four villag seed fair the follow are some basic fact and figur about the four seed fair describ in this studi particip central zone dabalo 26 peopl show crop 14 women 12 men 32 peopl and 1 school show crop 17 women 15 men 58 peopl and 1 school show crop 31 women 27 men misughaa total southern highland shinji 21 group and four individu farmer show crop these figur were not broken down accord to gender malinzanga number not avail in general more women than men farmer attend andor display crop and seed at the fair fewer women attend largerscal agricultur fair and exhibit becaus women rare travel long distanc and are less interest in the improv cash crop that largerscal event tend to concentr on crop categori display the tabl below show the categori of crop shown farmer focus main on stapl crop but mani neglect and collect crop were also shown few cash crop were shown research team member were surpris to find some new crop varieti that they had not seen befor women show far more collect crop than men did for exampl in dabalo in the central zone two men show collect crop compar with ten women cash crop central zone dabalo misughaa shinji malinsanga 3 4 0 0 stapl crop neglect crop 6 6 30 12 collet crop 6 8 10 2 new varieti 3 3 8 1 total 19 18 4 3 37 39 52 18 southern highland 12 far more local than

varieti pumpkin 14 varieti in dabalo central zone the follow were shown maiz 8 varieti sorghum 13 varieti song gourd 8 varieti cow pea 9 varieti in misughaa central zone the follow were shown sorghum 15 varieti spong gourd 8 varieti cowpea 6 varieti finger millet 7 varieti mlenda 7 varieti 13 annex 2 nlink project guidelin for conduct communiti seed fair project field research in rural communiti help to creat awar of local crop divers and relat issu among communiti member the research team and other stakehold a surpris number of farmer often know veri littl about the differ crop varieti that are be use by other farmer live in the same rural communiti research great increas farmer and research awar of crop divers within rural communiti and there is a need to strengthen this process further through the use of communiti event seed fair are a good way of achiev this at communiti seed fair farmer have the possibl of show and exchang small quantiti of their seed seed fair provid them with the opportun to meet and discuss not onli seed but also local practic and knowledg link to specif seed varieti in order to make seed fair afford for rural farmer they should be organ on a small scale and cover onli a few communiti base on the wealth of local crop varieti avail in the communiti seed fair focus main on local crop divers improv local neglect and collect crop hybrid seed can also be exhibit but they should not be the main focus of a fair the advantag of smallscal seed fair is that smallhold farmer can particip without problem few travel cost are involv and women who are the key peopl for neglect and collect crop find it easier to attend anoth advantag of local seed fair is that the seed display are easili access as they reli on local resourc rather than on those from outsid the communiti this make followup easier for the farmer when they have exchang seed varieti they can discuss their experi therebi strengthen further exchang and communic includ through the establish of local network the follow are some point to consid in the plan and implement of a communiti seed fair communiti ownership the most import factor in a use communiti seed fair is that the communiti feel ownership of it this can best be accomplish by give the lead role to a seed fair organ committe with communiti represent the format of a seed fair organ committe is the first action in the plan of a seed fair the committe should have repres from the communiti project research and extens staff school staff the church local group and organ women and men farmer and communiti leader the seed fair committe should then meet to plan and implement the seed fair clear role and respons should be defin for the committe member so that all the necessari arrang are made plan should start long befor the seed fair prefer around harvest time so that farmer can save suffici seed of the crop and varieti that they want to display sell or exchang a date that doe not conflict with other communiti event should be chosen for the seed fair this should prefer be short befor the plant season when farmer are most interest in buy seed the risk with this are that some farmer might have no seed left to display or they may have larg quantiti which they want to sell the committe should develop a programm for the seed fair the seed fair should be conduct by the communiti for the communiti theme object and activ the seed fair should be given a theme that captur the interest and signific of crop divers for the local communiti and suit local cultur the communiti need to have a 14 clear idea of the seed fair object so that activ can be plan and then evalu after the fair the follow are some suggest object for a seed fair a fair should have no more than two object object 1 rais awar of local crop divers at the rural communiti level display of crop divers with judg and award for the best display present by veri knowledg farmer on the crop divers that they conserv sketch song and danc relat to crop divers link project present on the find of field research object 2 educ the communiti includ the younger generat about crop divers with the involv of student an educ compon can be present that will help the futur conserv and use of crop divers present on nutrit and the cook of local crop divers highlight the nutrit valu of neglect and collect crop explain the import of nutriti food especi for hivaidsafflict peopl demonstr of process and storag for local crop involv of the local school includ student draw and essay on crop divers exchang of experi and inform about seed select and storag object 3 buy sell and barter seed to encourag the conserv of crop divers and spread it among local farmer farmer sale or exchang of small quantiti of local varieti object 4 encourag communitylevel product of crop divers sale or exchang of local varieti exchang of inform on local varieti plan of demonstr plot includ at the local school or with a farmer qualiti declar seed qds veri knowledg farmer or other plan the activ base on the identifi object the follow activ should be carri out an activ coordin is identifi to have overal respons for all the activ the activ coordin discuss and recruit communiti member who will be involv the activ coordin meet particip and agre the necessari plan to carri out the activ the activ coordin report to the communiti seed fair committe the activ coordin ensur that particip materi etc are readi for the seed fair the activ coordin review the activ with the particip and committe after the seed fair to discuss how it was receiv and how it could be improv the most knowledg farmer and women farmer should be especi encourag to particip in seed fair becaus they are the key resourc peopl for crop divers the seed fair should not be limit to hybrid and improv seed varieti or cash crop local seed fair are a good opportun to highlight and display the role and import of neglect and collect crop for food secur qds farmer should also particip 15 fund communiti seed fair must be sustain everi effort should be made to make the event selffund base on the contribut of time and effort from the committe and particip local sourc of sponsorship should be arrang if need ideal communiti seed fair should be held regular twice a year this would give farmer two reliabl opportun a year to find seed varieti that they have lost or long been look for public awar it is essenti to inform the communiti of the seed fair in advanc so that suffici seed is save for display and exchang local mean should be use to creat awar through announc at public event poster radio and leaflet conduct the seed fair the seed fair committe and activ coordin must plan in advanc where will the seed fair take place when will it take place what will it object be who will be invit who can display seed everybodi or onli certain peopl how will these peopl be identifi and select and accord to which criteria how can farmer who plant more varieti than other be encourag to particip what kind of materi is requir onli local materi need be use it is not necessari to build big stand as display can be arrang on piec of cloth spread on the ground what kind of seed will be expos local improv hybrid collect neglect wild etc what kind of award will be distribut where will they be obtain contact between activ coordin and particip is necessari what are activ coordin plan to do who will particip is a larg respons from the rural communiti expect what will particip have to do when will they have to start with the activ the farmer and the crop divers they display should be regist for followup after the event who will do this how will crop divers be regist where will this inform be store what will happen to this inform who is interest in this kind of inform the project staff should use this opportun to review the crop divers display compar this with the find of the studi and record addit crop divers a set programm should be follow as close as possibl start with an open statement by the seed fair committe and invit guest who will open the seed fair general event and individu present should follow 16 there should be an award present follow by a final close ceremoni who will select the award winner accord to which criteria who will close the seed fair award and recognit for the communiti member who are conserv crop divers recognit is an essenti element of a seed fair award can be provid for the most crop most varieti of a crop best display best activ and best present simpl award of seed certif or tool can be provid monitor and evalu after the seed fair the seed fair committe should meet to review how it was receiv and to determin how it could be improv and when the next seed fair should be held ideal seed fair should be organ twice or three time a year befor each plant season farmer need to understand the routin of regular seed fair 17 appendix 3 crop and biodivers display in dabalo villag central zone name sex crop display varieti local

concret and implement recommend to west african govern in this regard it should be also note that the demand for bushmeat both at nation and intern level offer busi opportun to exploit major wildlif speci through domest and ranch this would contribut in combat poverti and improv access to food product while preserv biolog divers nextdoor experi in southern and eastafrica can be advantag borrow

bennoah dir general of csir chairman of this workshop prof fobih minist of land forestri and mine invit guest ladi and gentlemen i am deepli honour to be ask to address such an import meet of expert and other stakehold assembl here to discuss the impact of bushmeat issu across out entir subregion mr chairman one of the import challeng face the countri in our subregion is how to feed our peopl and allevi rural poverti i believ that appropri manag and sustain harvest of some of our wildlif resourc have a major role to play in our food secur even though the import of anim protein in human nutrit is well acknowledg the livestock industri in ghana has receiv less attent than requir the contribut of the livestock subsector to food secur by suppli part of the daili calori and the protein intak essenti for nutrit adequaci has not been impress the declin consumpt of anim product as indic by the low calor and protein intak suggest that the suppli of anim product from both the local and import sourc have not kept pace with increas demand this is part due to popul growth and increas urbanis it is within this context that this confer is of much import to the ministri of agricultur and the nation at larg it should therefor receiv the desir attent to 32 ensur adequ contribut of wildlif to the nation food secur under a more sustain and environment friend condit than what pertain at the moment mr chairman the growth of the domest rumin livestock industri in ghana has been imped by sever constraint includ lack of breed stock inadequ stock water and poor market system notwithstand this recent develop in the livestock industri show that the countri has the potenti to increas the takeoff of livestock and produc good qualiti meat and milk to satisfi a greater part of the nation anim protein requir i must howev admit that the countri is far from meet her demand for anim protein from local sourc within the next few year we therefor have no option but to continu to util substanti part of scarc foreign exchang to import larg volum of livestock meat and dairi product annual to supplement local product i wish to acknowledg the complimentari effect of wildlif to food secur in the countri it is a well known fact that bushmeat has over the year contribut signific to the total anim protein intak of ghanaian and in particular those in the rural area agricultur has howev experienc some negat effect of harvest eg wildlif occasion damag to econom tree has been attribut to some larg anim while rodent are known to have caus tremend damag to various crop bird in their attempt to satisfi their nutrit requir do caus consider loss to rice harvest we should howev not underestim the numer benefici effect of wildlif to agricultur as demonstr by the role of fli insect and bat in 33 pollin we must therefor find appropri way of optimis the benefit of the symbol effect of agricultur and wildlif in enhanc food secur mr chairman although bush fire sometim occur as a result of uncontrol burn of bush after harvest for the purpos of remov rank veget most of the bush fire could be attribut to hunt for wildlif damag done by such fire to the natur pastur which provid susten to rumin livestock and to a larger number of our wildlif is veri signific this make bush fire a major contribut factor to declin in the condit of graze land in the dri season as well as a great constraint to the develop of our domest livestock it also caus high mortal to wildlif and it is common to see a larg number of burnt wildlif includ snail after occurr of bush fire current most of the grasscutt meat found on the market come from activ of group of peopl and individu who hunt down these anim by either set fire to bush especi dure the dri season or use trap and even chemic poison to trap these anim none of these method is commend and should be total discourag due to their harm effect on the environ and on consum one may therefor ask how we can continu to enjoy our cherish grasscutt meat in the light of the abov circumst we have to decid between two option to chang our eat habit which we cannot or to develop a sustain mean of produc the meat we enjoy eat most the latter option which is more progress sustain and environment friend will guarante yearround suppli of the meat that ghanaian so much relish to this end mr chairman the ministri of food and agricultur in collabor with the anim research institut of the council for scientif and 34 industri research and some ngos has commenc grasscutt domest and breed programm as well as extens servic to get as mani peopl as possibl to be interest to take up grasscutt product the recent past has also wit the emerg of ostrich farm with popul grow steadili in the last five year as a ministri we intend to upscal the

reduc fish pressur on overexploit fisheri seawe farm has been incorpor into mani communitybas coastal resourc manag project and fisheri manag initi as an altern livelihood option for fisher in tropic develop countri this is typic base on sever assumpt either unstat or explicit of program design project manag and senior polici maker first it is often assum that smallscal fisher are poor and that this is relat in mani case to the overexploit natur of the resourc second it is assum that fisher are will to give up fish in favor of more lucrat econom opportun such as seawe farm last it is assum that as fisher take up altern livelihood such as seawe farm this will reduc pressur on the fisheri this is an excel exampl of a project logic framework wherebi certain input eg promot of seawe farm will lead to specif output eg improv socioeconom status of fisher reduc fish pressur and improv resourc status this paper will examin the evid under these assumpt and the extent to which develop of seawe farm as an altern livelihood can increas socioeconom status of fisher and reduc fish pressur base on a number of exampl from coastal communiti in north sulawesi indonesia introduct seawe is harvest throughout the world as a food sourc as well as an export commod for the product of agar and carrageenan product seawe has been cultur tradit for decad and probabl for centuri in sever asian nation such as china korea and japan until about 1980 most of the seawe product from other nation in the region has been from the harvest of wild stock although limit cultur took place in nation such as the philippin and indonesia trono 1990 speci harvest includ varieti of eucheuma gracilaria and porphyra among other in the philippin seawe export increas almost twenti fold from 675 mt in 1967 to 13191 mt in 1980 trono 1990 and anoth doubl of product occur over the next five year to 28000 mt in 1985 trono and ganzonfort 1989 indonesia also saw increas in product from an estim 1000 mt after world war ii to almost 6000 mt in 1966 soegiarto and sulustijo 1990 between 1984 and 1991 product of seawe increas from 9100 mt to 19000 mt nrmp 1996 eucheuma contribut to 78 percent of indonesian seawe product in 1991 nrmp 1996 eucheuma was and remain a major compon of seawe export from these countri and one of the lead fisheri export product as earli as the 1970s it was recogn that demand for seawe and seawe product was outstrip suppli and cultiv was view as the best mean to increas product naylor 1976 growth in demand start to spur research and develop of cultur method and to address problem in the industri such as poor qualiti and fluctuat price the profit natur of seawe farm also becam evid and acceler it expans for exampl a studi from the southern philippin in 1974 on the develop of familyfarm cultiv system demonstr that for plot of approxim one hectar net incom from eucheuma farm was five to six time the minimum averag wage of an agricultur worker naylor 1976 seawe

particular on the biolog biochemistri util market and econom of product ganzonfort et al 1991 while mani report discuss the econom of seawe farm and mention it valu as a profit livelihood activ few studi have empir examin the extent to which the adopt of seawe farm has affect other household sourc of incom or the impact on fish effort cultur method the earliest seawe farm guid in the philippin juanich 1988 trono and ganzonfort 1989 recommend cultiv of seawe farm on seagrass and reef flat at approxim 1meter depth at low tide they recommend the cut of seagrass and remov of sea urchin prior to farm construct seedl are then tie to monofila line and strung between mangrov stake pound into the substrat this off bottom method of cultiv is still one of the major method use today a newer long line cultiv method can be use in deeper water of approxim 7 meter depth fmc 1999 this method use float cultiv line anchor to the bottom and is the primari method use in the villag of tumbak and bentenan on the maluku sea coast of north sulawesi indonesia pollnac et al 1997a 1997b environment impact seawe farm is consid relat benign compar to other maricultur farm practic de silva 1992 henc

method as practic in most area of bentenan and tumbak is consid more environment benign as these deeper water farm are usual place over sandi bottom and do not requir alter of bottom habitat howev the expans of farm between 1997 and 2000 in an area with limit farm space has led to farm be construct on top of or adjac to coral reef increas the threat to coastal ecosystem in addit this crowd of sea space in bentenan has led to conflict concern boat entri and exit from moor and beach launch area dimpudus 1999 pollnac et al 2002 the villag has design sever boat passag where no construct of farm is

is to rais the econom standard of live of fisher and coastal communiti and the second is to reduc fish effort altern livelihood as a solut to overfish has been propos for more than two decad smith 1979 recommend altern incom sourc such as seawe farm as one type of incent to reduc fish pressur as long as they are attract enough to reduc fulltim fish howev he also report that philippin survey at that time indic that onli 50 of fisher are will to chang their occup with household more depend on fish more recept to occup chang willing to chang was also higher in more geograph isol locat among poorer younger less educ and less success fishermen group less like to accept the risk of a new activ therefor he recommend an emphasi on supplement rather than altern employ encourag a shift from

declin overal this is not to impli that project assist to support seawe farm was unwis or not benefici to the communiti it seem to be benefici in two way first as an incom earner for household particip and as a communitybas coastal resourc manag entri point to discourag destruct fish practic howev the discuss below suggest that seawe farm should be view more as a supplement incom earner rather than an as altern incom the report on the philippin project therefor right character seawe farm as a supplement incom earner the success of seawe farm is depend on the market price earli success and introduct when price are high may not be sustain when price drop this has occur on sever occas for exampl smith 1980 investig chang with regard to seawe farm in bohol provinc of the philippin onli a few seawe farm were oper in 1978 but by 1979 one third of the communiti was involv seawe farmer were make two to seven time the incom from fish befor seawe farm was introduc howev by the end of 1979 overproduct had driven price down to a level where farm were no longer profit a similar commod price cycl had occur in tawitawi provinc in 19745 on bohol some seawe farmer start to switch back to fish onc seawe price fell in anoth exampl seawe farm was success introduc in 1982 in tonga onli to be discontinu in 1986 due to low price among other factor ffa 2002 a similar situat occur in the solomon island with eucheuma farm introduc in 1985 and then abandon due to market collaps kile 2000 seawe farm initi in samoa in 1991 was discontinu in 1992 skelton et al 2000 it is quit evid that seawe farm has been promot for more than two decad as an econom activ for coastal communiti there is consider empir evid that seawe farm is a profit ventur for coastal household howev the claim that seawe farm reduc fish pressur has been not been critic research to ani great extent most inform support this claim has been anecdot where there is empir evid of reduct in fish also see the bunaken case below it is uncertain whether this is a shortterm effect due to market price increas or a longterm result as previous state there have been sever instanc of market price collaps where seawe farm has been abandon these report suggest that when there is a seawe market price drop seawe farmer stop farm and move into other occup most like result onli in a temporari reduct of fish effort in other case such as in bentenan and tumbak describ below there seem to be littl effect on fish even dure period of farm expans henc seawe farm as a mean of reduc fish effort remain a poor test and support hypothesi it may not occur as often as the convent wisdom might expect the situat is more complic than polici maker might assum factor that are like to play a role in determin the impact of seawe farm on fish effort includ job satisfact among fisher and occup multipl among rural coastal household these factor are discuss below job satisfact in fisheri smith 1979 describ job mobil and willing to chang occup as import consider in the design of polici to reduc fish effort for instanc develop countri have attempt to address the overfish issu through vessel buyback program mani of which have encount roadblock with respect to occup chang in these largescal industri fisheri there has been an emphasi on reduc capit equip vessel as a measur of effort howev these program also realiz that socioeconom concern and attitud of fisher includ exit from the fisheri need to be address in a review of sever vessel buyback program holland et al 1999 conclud that vessel buyback alon will not be effect unless integr with other program such as social servic and job train so fisher leav the fisheri can find altern employ european program have implement these suggest and even promot aquacultur develop as an altern to help individu in the econom depress fish sector holland et al 1999 a review of experi with vessel buyback program illustr some of the difficulti encount in attempt to implement fisher exit strategi in canada for instanc licens retir scheme were propos to reduc fleet capac and requir fisher to retir from the fisheri as well this result in a lack of interest in the program by fisher sinc they had sever fish licens and did not want to leav fish altogeth holland et al 1999 in the danish fisheri some fisher that left the ground fisheri enter the shrimp fisheri result in a 50 increas in capac of the latter holland et al 1999 the tendenc for fisher to reenter the fisheri sector doe not seem to be adequ address by mani of these buyback program in addit it is uncertain to what extent the altern livelihood train and promot had on improv econom status of fisher in new occup or in keep them perman out of the fisheri sector livelihood altern propos and attempt may have been either poor econom substitut or less satisfi occup for fisher result in fisher reenter the fisheri or reinforc reluct to exit pollnac et al 2001 studi job satisfact in three southeast asian fisheri the research conduct among smallscal fisher in the philippin indonesia and vietnam indic that most fisher would not leav fish for an altern occup mani fisher cite incom as the reason this studi tend to discount a common polici assumpt that fisher are poor and therefor will to switch to other more econom lucrat occup crawford et al 1999a describ signific variabl of incom among fisher in indonesia as well as variabl relat to other sector they also demonstr that while coastal communiti in the minahasa district of north sulawesi provinc tend to be less develop than inland communiti it was not relat to the percent of fisher resid in the communiti the tendenc of coastal communiti to be less develop was relat to isol this also suggest that fisher are not alway the poorest of the poor and therefor a potenti reason for unwilling to leav the fisheri allison 2001 suggest that entri and exit into a fisheri is relat to incom level of fisher relat to other sector howev in an east africa lake fisheri ikiara and odink 2000 conclud that fisher remain in their occup not becaus it is less profit than other sector but due to a lack of altern they found that fisher resist to exit the fisheri was relat to the opportun cost of exit fish experi and vessel ownership pollnac et al 2001 also demonstr that noneconom factor influenc exit decis their studi cite pleasur aspect of the occup as well as tradit as some of the noneconom reason for fisher to resist occup chang howev those will to chang occup had specif characterist in each countri therefor fisheri manag could perhap tailor altern livelihood and exit program to this particular subset of fisher in a case studi of the introduct of brackishwat farm to a group smallscal fisher in the philippin pomeroy 1992 observ that of fisher that particip in a farm cooper 18 month after it was start all continu to fish and sever lost interest in the farm prefer to fish this exampl demonstr that introduct of altern livelihood may increas incom sourc but doe not seem to take fisher out of the fisheri have no impact on fish effort fisher job satisfact result in sever fisher reenter the fisheri and of the other they could still fish in addit to engag in the new farm activ it suggest that rural labor may not be fulli util and these fisher may have underutil time they can alloc to addit econom activ in area where there is high unemploy or underemploy exit from the fisheri may not occur in the case abov sever fisher ad an addit occup to their repertoir of livelihood activ rather than substitut of one activ for anoth this concept of occup multipl is discuss below occup multipl in rural coastal household high level of occup multipl often character household in rural coastal communiti especi in southeast asia pollnac et al 1997a observ that in coastal communiti in north sulawesi it was not unusu for household to have sever sourc of incom especi a mix of fish and farm in the villag of tumbak for instanc 50 percent of household engag in three or more product activ pollnac et al 1997b and 28 percent are engag in five or more activ in other coastal communiti in north sulawesi a similar pattern is seen on the island of talis 62 percent of household are engag in four or more activ and 36 percent in at least five activ crawford et al 1999b in the villag of blongko 51 percent of household are involv in four activ 30 percent in at least five activ and 12 percent in six or more activ kussoy et al 1999 for each household engag in fish sever differ gear type may be use depend on speci target and fish season for instanc 22 gear type are use in talis crawford et al 1999b and 16 gear type are use in blongko kussoy et al 1999 farmer maintain a larg number of crop as well for instanc 37 percent of farm household grow six or more crop type in blongko kussoy et al 1999 and 31 percent of farm household grow four or more crop type in talis crawford et al 1999b the predomin of occup vari between communiti as well in a studi of three javanes coastal communiti collier et al 1977 demonstr that primari employ of household head differ consider among three villag studi for exampl fish vari from 42 percent to a low of 0 percent farm vari from 11 percent to a high of 80 percent while brackishwat fish farm vari from 0 to 14 percent they indic that occup multipl was also common and note that mani rice farmer own brackishwat fishpond and were also involv in fish addit within one year between survey period they also report rapid shift in occup class toward more landless labor pollnac et al 2002 also report major shift in household occup in tumbak over a short period of time between 1997 and 2000 the percent of household engag in seawe farm increas from 23 to 93 percent relat import of seawe farm also increas from no household rank it the most import activ in 1997 to 65 percent in 2000 the tumbak case also demonstr potenti high mobil among the rural labor forc and the rapid with which occup structur within and among coastal household can vari and adapt to chang circumst collier et al 1977 conclud that to support a famili in java famili member must be engag in a number of job to surviv demonstr that occup multipl is an import econom strategi for rural coastal communiti pollnac et al 1997a has also suggest that a high level of occup multipl in coastal communiti is an effect econom strategi occup divers allow household to shift the mix and relat import of product activ depend on the opportun and circumst at hand it also provid insur against ecolog catastroph such as drought or a sudden collaps in the fisheri for instanc the villag of bentenan in north sulawesi was impact by the 1998 el nino event that result in virtual no rain for 13 month one women interview in 1998 remark even though all our crop have fail thank god we still have the sea to provid for us longitudin studi conduct on island villag of talis aerbanua and kahuku in north sulawesi indonesia between 1997 and 2000 by sukmara et al 2001 provid insight into how the introduct of new occup into a communiti may influenc occup characterist in talis the number of household engag in fish increas from 69 to 83 percent and the rank of fish as the most import activ increas from 33 to 49 percent in the neighbor villag of aerbanua and kahuku there was veri littl increas in total number of household engag in fish from 80 to 83 percent and fish as the most import activ declin slight from 43 to 40 percent popul increas in talis at a rate of 66 percent per annum between 1997 and 2000 compar to 17 and 22 percent respect for kahuku and aerbanua on small island such as these there are veri few altern employ opportun it suggest that in the face of rapid popul increas over a short period of time on talis fish is like to take up a good portion of the increas in the labor forc this exampl support the assert made earlier that the rapid inmigr into bunaken park due to seawe farm may eventu lead to increas in total fish effort in spite of the fact that mani individu have switch from fish to seawe farm one altern employ opportun introduc in the late 1980s to talis island was a largescal pearl farm approxim 100 individu from talis are employ with this compani unfortun no data is avail on the occup of pearl farm employe prior to work at the pearl farm howev of the 11 household survey that list pearl farm employe as an occup eight rank it as their primari household activ five rank fish as a an addit secondari or lower prioriti household activ the pearl farm has provid addit employ on the island but household employ with the pearl farm still reli to some extent on fish support smith assert of view supplement livelihood as shift fisher from full to parttim status the percent of household employ in pearl farm show veri littl chang in talis between 1997 and 2000 increas from 13 to 15 percent of household survey with littl chang in rank from 10 to 11 percent as the most import household activ there has been some expans of the pearl farm previous survey indic no one in kahuku and aerbanua was employ with the pearl farm howev survey in 2000 indic that 16 percent of household were employ with the pearl farm howev in spite of this new altern employ opportun there was onli neglig chang in percent of household engag in fish 80 in 1997 to 82 in 2000 and rank of fish 43 as first rank in 1997 to 40 in 2000 the data again indic that the avail of altern employ has had littl impact on fish anoth import aspect of altern employ is gender and age distribut among the labor forc male typic domin captur fisheri as the primari atsea labor altern livelihood such as seawe farm can have veri differ characterist of gender and age distribut in the labor forc therefor introduct of altern livelihood such as seawe farm is like to affect more than just the occup characterist of the male member of the communiti for instanc in bentenan and tumbak villag of north sulawesi adult male make up between 67 to 100 percent of the labor forc for the 13 gear type use in the communiti pollnac et al 1997b adult femal particip in fish with adult male but onli with four of the 13 gear type use where femal do fish they onli provid between 5 to 33 percent of the labor by contrast the percentag of onli adult male be engag in seawe farm vari between 36 to 50 percent adult male and femal make up between 38 to 45 percent wherea adult male femal and children of both sex make up between 9 to 13 percent of the labor pollnac et al 1997b in india there are more than twice the number of femal that gather seawe compar to male kaladharan and kaliaperum 1999 in zanzibar femal are the main labor engag in seawe farm bayer t per comm 2002 sinc femal and children can be involv in seawe farm the impact on these individu should also be consid in polici that promot altern livelihood where male make up onli a fraction of the labor pool in seawe farm there is less likelihood that perman occup shift from fish will occur case studi of seawe farm in north sulawesi indonesia bunaken park seawe farm was start in bunaken nation park in 1989 but remain a rather minor econom activ until an increas in market price occur in 1992 when it becam more econom attract than fish merril 1998 a 1996 survey nrmp 1996 provid an overview of seawe farm in the park approxim 436 hectar are farm use the off bottom method on the reef flat within the park the major occur around nain island a group farm and market system is practic wherebi farmer sell to a group leader who in turn sell to an export averag month incom from seawe farm was report rp 650000 per month us 290month merril suggest that seawe farm has led to acceler inmigr within the park into villag where seawe farm is practic in addit he also report that unsustain harvest of the park mangrov resourc start to occur as a result of increas demand for mangrov pole use for seawe cultiv the off bottom cultiv method also caus coral damag the profit of seawe farm is start to caus conflict over cultiv space due to the lack of a formal marin tenur system for seawe farm the 1996 survey nrmp 1996 investig occup chang that have occur due to the introduct of seawe farm in six park villag data indict that in five out of the six villag where seawe was farm 98 to 100 percent of household were engag in seawe farm with a total of 1439 household involv in seawe farm throughout the park approxim sixti percent of seawe farmer start farm in 1995 due to the tripl of market price between 1992 and 1996 reason for the shift includ profit low capit invest need for entri and eas of cultiv questionnair survey of seawe farmer indic that 54 percent of seawe farmer were former fisher and had given up fish to becom seawe farmer other occup that seawe farmer engag in prior to seawe farm includ farm 12 and construct 94 among other unfortun the survey use respond as the unit of measur rather than the household and consid occup as a singular activ therefor no inform on other occup activ such as parttim fish or fish by other household member are provid the survey report did not provid a breakdown of respond or seawe farm by gender so the impact of the introduct of seawe farm on the overal household and on women was not assess the bunaken experi demonstr that seawe farm can lead to a major occup shift from fish to seawe farm howev the longterm impact of increas inmigr and price fluctuat on occup chang and overal fish effort is uncertain sinc marin space for seawe farm is limit onc all farm area are occupi addit resid will seek altern mean of livelihood and are therefor like to enter the fisheri increas popul therefor is like to lead to an increas in fish effort over the long term sinc the fisheri remain open access in addit entri into and exit from seawe farm is dictat larg by price fluctuat this studi has shown that when price rise peopl enter the practic of seawe farm howev as previous mention there are sever exampl show that when price drop individu abandon seawe farm and return to other occup at least one studi has shown that a return to fish is like smith 1980 pollnac et al 1997 observ sever exampl of other communiti in north sulawesi that had taken up and then abandon seawe farm in the past a recent drop in seawe price in 2001 has led to a reduct in seawe farm in the bentenantumbak area of north sulawesi unsrat 2001 this case will be discuss in further detail below howev the impact of a price drop on fish effort in bentenan and tumbak has not yet been studi the effect of the price drop on seawe farm and fish in bunaken nation park has also not been examin bentenan and tumbak villag mantjoro 1997 indic that seawe farm was introduc to bentenan and tumbak in the 1980s but it eventu fail it was reintroduc in 1996 pollnac e al 1997b as in bunaken there are no marin tenur right to seawe farm area it is open access and first claimant have right the head of villag mediat conflict the long line and off bottom method of cultur are both use cultiv area increas between 1997 and 1999 from 105 hectar to 378 hectar dimpudus et al 1999 as previous describ the import of seawe farm has increas dramat from onli 23 percent of household engag in this activ in 1997 to almost 93 percent in 2000 with 69 percent of household in 2000 rank it as the activ of primari import to the household pollnac et al 2002 report that household engag in seawe farm can earn between rp 3600000 to 5400000 us 400 600 per annum from this activ as previous mention seawe farm is practic by adult male and femal as well as children femal and children are involv in the dri of seawe and with the prepar of new line and propagul for the next crop femal have even been observ work alongsid husband tend line and harvest seawe a task that some do from nonmotor boat howev while the percent of onli adult male engag in seawe farm in 1997 vari between 36 to 50 percent this had drop to an averag of 4 percent in 2000 adult femal and male increas to 62 percent and adult and children increas to 34 percent henc the rapid increas in seawe farm has result in an increas in the number of women and children involv in this activ pollnac et al 2002 report that sinc fish is carri out at differ time of the day than seawe farm and the involv of women and children there has been littl chang in fish effort onli three percent of fisher report that they have reduc fish activ as a result of take up seawe farm some women report a reduct in household chore and childcar as a result of involv with seawe farm conclus the case of bentenan and tumbak contrast sharpli with bunaken this is a surpris find as all of the villag are locat in the district of minahasa and feed the same intern seawe market chain base in the provinci capit of manado these differ requir further investig it should be note that the inform on bentenan and tumbak is base on an ongo longitudin studi rather than on a one time period survey as was conduct in bunaken the bentenan and tumbak studi also address occup multipl and the role of women and children which was not address in the bunaken studi this clear demonstr that for research on seawe farm as an altern livelihood the household is a better unit of measur rather than individu farmer in addit the characterist of gender and age within the labor pool need to be care assess occup multipl of rural household also requir that occup structur be examin in greater detail survey that assum singl occup among rural household do accur portray the real world situat a recent report by unsrat 2001 also indic that seawe farm is again on the declin in bentenan and tumbak due to market price drop and therefor like in bunaken as well thus we see a continu of a repeat boom and bust cycl that occur in bentenan and tumbak villag in the 1980s and that has also occur elsewher the respons of resid in these communiti to chang econom circumst demonstr their acumen at rapid adapt with high level of occup multipl within the household famili can easili adjust their activ to take advantag of the econom opportun that present themselv and also adjust when certain sector face a downturn return to smith earlier admonish to emphas supplement livelihood among fisher seawe farm in the bentenan and tumbak case tend to be a good fit to the supplement livelihood model wherea the bunaken case tend to fit the altern livelihood model sinc seawe farm and other altern or supplement livelihood do not alway result in reduct in fish this goal need to be care reassess and perhap abandon altogeth where fish effort reduct is a strategi more care investig and tailor of livelihood develop program will be need to ensur exit object are met more specif unless livelihood strategi are combin with resourc manag strategi that address that open access natur of coastal fisheri progress toward improv fisheri manag will be limit howev it seem that livelihood develop and econom improv in the welfar of coastal communiti can be achiev through programmat initi provid altern livelihood to fisher that simultan improv their econom condit and reduc fish pressur can be achiev in some instanc howev in case where fisher do not fulli exit the fioisheri and a shift from full to part time fish is like a limit degre of effort reduct can result at least temporarili whether seawe cultiv lead to entri or exit from fish depend to some extent on world market and price for seawe howev noneconom factor often keep fisher in the occup of fish the viewpoint of supplement livelihood rather than altern livelihood make better sens as this strategi attempt to reduc household depend on fish but acknowledg that some fisher may still like to engag in fish howev with popul growth and low employ exit from fish doe not prevent entri as well so even if some fisher leav to take up altern employ there will be new entrant these new entrant will still be face with the same dilemma of previous fisher too mani fisher and not enough fish exacerb the overfish problem and drive down earn per fisher without some form of limit entri the fisheri will tend to move to the econom equilibrium point of opportun wage as previous note there may be sever reason whi the fisheri move below the open access equilibrium point as predict by classic bioeconom model of a fisheri in addit while some fisher may do well other will do poor as some degre of incom variabl and nonequ will alway exist onli if region employ and wage increas can overal wage of fisher increas altern livelihood to some extent can contribut in this regard but econom overfish will still occur with an open access regim rather than emphas altern and supplement livelihood develop program should learn from the tradit econom strategi demonstr by the coastal communiti and household in the north sulawesi case econom diversif may be a better goal than altern or supplement livelihood diversif is a common busi strategi and rural household can in fact be consid as smallscal busi diversif provid stabil to famili and the abil to amelior and surviv through period of largescal ecolog and global market chang this may be a better

fbs data with what would be requir for good nutrit the paramet for the latter are well known11 though not devoid of controversi in the first place there is the amount of food or dietari energi that is need for the human bodi to function at rest breath pump blood etc even without allow for movement or activ this is the basal or rest metabol rate bmr or rmr it is in the general rang 13001700 kcalday

structur will be differ with a higher proport of adult it follow that popul group in which an averag individu has habitu an intak below this level the threshold are undernourish becaus they do not eat enough to maintain health bodi weight and to engag in light activ the result is physic and mental impair characterist for the former are evidenc in nutrit anthropometr survey estim the preval of undernourish mean estim the proport of popul with food intak below these threshold it is note that the notion measur and definit of threshold of requir are not devoid of controversi for exampl svedberg 200112 consid that the threshold use in the n measur of undernourish for the tropic countri are too high lead to overestim of undernourishment12 in principl a countri have nation averag kcalpersonday equal to the threshold would have no undernourish problem provid all person engag in onli light activ and each person had access to food exact accord to hisher respect requir howev this is never the case some peopl consum or have access to more food than their respect light activ requir eg becaus they engag in more energydemand work or have high household wast or simpli overeat and other peopl less than their requir usual becaus they cannot afford more thus an allow must be made for such unequ access empir evid suggest that the inequ measur use in these estim the coeffici of variat cv rang from 02 to 036 in the differ countri a cv of 02 mean rough that the averag differ of the food intak of individu from the nation averag the standard deviat is 20 percent of the nation averag even at the lowest level of inequ general found in the empir data cv02 the nation averag kcalpersonday must be well abov the threshold if the proport of popul undernourish is to be veri low for exampl a countri with threshold 1800 kcal and cv020 must have a nation averag of 2700 kcalpersonday if the proport undernourish is to be onli 25 percent or 2900 if it is to be 1 percent natur if inequ were more pronounc these requir would be higher these number or norm are therefor a first guid to assess the adequaci or otherwis of the nation averag food consumpt level in the fbs data and express in kcalpersonday this latter number is the princip variabl use to generat estim of the preval of undernourish as explain elsewher n 1996b more technic discuss in naiken 200313 numer countri fall below the nation averag energi level kcalpersonday requir for undernourish to be veri low in mani case they fall below by consider margin therefor even if one knew noth more about the preval of undernourish the inevit conclus for these countri is that it must be signific rang from moder to high or veri high even when inequ of access to food is moder it follow that progress toward reduc or elimin undernourish must manifest itself in the first place in the form of increas per capita food consumpt natur this is not equival to say that the food consumpt shown in the fbs data is itself a variabl which can be oper upon direct by polici for it to rise somebodi must consum more food and the food must come from somewher product or import the polici to rais nation averag consumpt are those which enhanc the purchas power and more general access to food of those who would consum more if they had the mean for exampl access to resourc and technolog to improv their own food product capac access to nonfarm employ social polici etc the point made here is that chang in the nation averag kcalpersonday record in the fbs data do signal the direct and magnitud of movement toward improv or worsen food secur status how reliabl are the fbs data sinc in mani case they show veri low or veri high level of nation averag food consumpt or sudden spurt or collaps the answer is they are as reliabl as main the primari data on product and trade suppli by the countri as well as the estim made for nonfood use and loss of food commod and the popul data use to express them in per capita terms14 it is these data and estim that are process in the form of the fbs to deriv the indic of per capita food consumpt as nation averag use here given the primari data the conclus that mani countri are in a difficult food secur situat follow logic and inevit 12 work is current underway to revis the threshold use in the estim of undernourish 13 these key variabl kcalpersonday and the cv are use as paramet of the lognorm statist distribut with kcalpersonday as the mean to estim the percentag of popul undernourish 14 in some case the popul data themselv are a prime sourc of error in the estim of food consumpt

rare effect a combin of control method usual is requir if total exclus is not use or is not feasibl at a facil then the goal of damag control should be to reduc loss to an accept level while incur the lowest possibl cost facil manag should recogn that some loss is unavoid even with the best predat manag strategi which control method to use depend on a rang of factor includ the number and speci of bird involv the sever of the predat problem and the type and size of the facil to be protect time and cost factor also play an import role in determin the control method to be util the expect benefit of begin a control program must outweigh it cost some of the most common damag control techniqu and the primari advantag and disadvantag of each are describ on the follow page barrier two type of physic barrier can be use for control bird predat at aquacultur facil 1 complet enclosur which total exclud predat from gain access to cultur stock and 2 partiallycov system which interfer with predat feed behavior complet enclosur are extrem effect against all bird but are more expens than partial exclosur system the select of a barrier method depend on the bird involv in the problem the type and size of the facil to be protect local weather condit the barrier effect on site aesthet and whether the barrier will interfer with other oper all physic barrier should be visibl to bird to maxim the effect of the barrier and to minim the potenti for accident injuri or entrap total exclus total exclus is the complet enclosur of fish tank raceway andor pond with screen cage or net figur 1 a 1 to 2inch mesh net support by overhead wire or secur to frame can be use to exclud all fisheat bird gate and other open also must be cover figur 2 placement of mesh panel direct on raceway is effect and allow for remov of the barrier for clean purpos andor when the barrier is no longer need a small mesh wire or net less than 1 inch should be instal and secur to a pipe or wooden frame to prevent feed through the panel panel should be design to accommod feed system all exclus structur must be strong enough to withstand the weight of sever larg bird and to keep the barrier from sag to within a bird strike distanc of the water addit exclus structur should be construct to allow for mainten feed harvest and other oper a strong support framework is particular import in area with sever weather condit ie high wind snowfal dure ice and snow storm overhead net may be rip apart or support pole may collaps as such this method may not be appropri in area that experi extrem weather condit pulley line and counterweight may be necessari to facilit lift and lower of nonrigid exclosur system dure period of nonus advers weather condit or mainten figur 1 complet enclosur figur 2 curtaintyp gate for access

partial enclosur of tank raceway andor pond with wire line and fenc partial exclosur interfer with bird activ at a site rather than complet prevent their access they are less effect than total exclus system but are less expens to construct overhead line and wire raceway and pond can be cover with heavygaug monofila line or hightensil galvan or stainless steel wire suspend horizont in a grid pattern or in one direct over the water surfac figur 3 overhead linewir system are most effect against fli predat such as tern gull cormor and osprey rather than against wade bird side and end should be protect as bird may attempt to enter the area by these rout figur 4 figur 3 overhead line or wire the space of lineswir depend on the feed habit and size of the problem speci wire with space of 10

bird requir about 30 feet figur 4 net where wire attach to build prevent bird from walk down the roof and jump through the wire into the facil overhead linewir system like total exclus system are impract for larg pond due to the difficulti of span larg distanc anoth problem is that bird may learn to avoid the overhead lineswir asid from replac an occasion broken wire and maintain adequ wire tension overhead linewir system typic requir littl mainten perimet fenc and wire wire or perimet fenc around pond or raceway can provid some protect from wade bird although bird may eventu learn to avoid these obstacl figur 5 these system are larg ineffect against fli predat for pond fenc that is at least 3 feet high should be construct in water that is 23 feet deep small fish may be prevent from enter the shallow water by construct the fenc with a small mesh materi although this may requir the remov of alga buildup from time to time construct of inwardangl or vertic barrier typic made of plastic net chicken wire or monofila line around raceway or pond may prevent predat from forag from the edg of a hold structur or from enter raceway and pond from the side in general wade bird prefer to land on solid ground befor wade into the edg of pond fenc should be high enough to prohibit feed from the wall electr wire and fenc use of electr fenc has had vari level of success larg depend on the design of the cultur facil and the type of bird speci involv in this method electr wirefenc of the type specif design for agricultur fenc applic is place around the perimet of pond andor raceway this method is more effect than unelectrifi wiresfenc as bird cannot push against the wiresf in anoth applic electr wire may be strung on support that suspend them over the water edg near the natur shelf that often form in shallow area of the pond margin this system discourag wade bird from feed on fish while walk along the shelf howev if pond bottom slope too gradual from the bank wade bird may still be abl to fish on the water side of the fenc great care must be taken when instal and use electr fenc to ensur it safe oper oper should be knowledg about electr fenc or should get qualifi profession help prior to instal this type of system electr fenc should onli be charg with commerci electr fenc charg that send brief puls of electr through the fenc charg must be nonleth to human and bird like perimet fenc and wire this techniqu is most effect against wade bird also like perimet fencingwir bird may learn to avoid these obstacl this system is ineffect against gull tern cormor and pelican that typic fish in the central part of the pond other problem includ mainten and prevent the system from becom ground common caus by blow debri and interfer from veget a combin of electrifi or

aV phosphorus limit of microbi process in moist tropic forest evid from shortterm laboratori incub and field studi abstract although there is a widespread belief that phosphorus p limit basic ecosystem process in moist tropic forest direct test of this supposit are rare at the same time it is general believ that p doe not limit soil microorgan respir or growth in terrestri ecosystem we use natur gradient in p fertil creat by soil of vari age under tropic rain forest in southwestern costa rica combin with direct manipul of carbon c and p suppli to test the effect of p avail on the decomposit of multipl form of c includ dissolv organ carbon doc and soil organ carbon soc result from a combin of laboratori and field experi suggest that c decomposit in old high weather oxisol soil is strong constrain by p avail in addit p addit to these soil no c ad also reveal that microbi util of at least labil fraction of soc was also p limit to our knowledg this is the first direct evid of p limit of microbi process in tropic rain forest soil we suggest that p limit of microbi decomposit may have profound implic for c cycl in moist tropic forest includ their potenti respons to increas atmospher carbon dioxid furthermor this site is still relat rich in p when compar to mani other tropic forest on old soil thus we believ that p limit of soil microorgan throughout the humid tropic is a possibl key word decomposit soil microorgan nutrient limit fertil tropic rain forest phosphorus carbon introduct in mani terrestri ecosystem primari product and other basic ecosystem process are constrain by low rate of nutrient suppli although some except do exist substanti amount of data from temper and high latitud ecosystem demonstr that in the absenc of anthropogen perturb nitrogen n frequent limit plant growth and organ matter storag aber and other 1991 vitousek and howarth 1991 this knowledg aris from a wide varieti of data includ multipl direct manipul of extern nutrient suppli in contrast we lack a thorough understand of the effect of low nutrient avail on basic ecosystem process in moist tropic forest ecosystem limit in moist tropic forest tem which present a uniqu set of problem relat to nutrient cycl and limit for exampl in contrast to most temper system nitrogen appear to cycl in relat excess in mani lowland tropic rain forest martinelli and other 1999 moreov mani of these forest lie on extrem old high weather soil that are deplet in rockderiv essenti element includ base cation calcium ca magnesium mg potassium k and phosphorus p uehara and gillman 1981 vitousek and sanford 1986 thus where nutrient are a major constraint in tropic forest on old soil this constraint like come from some combin of base cation andor phosphorus avail vitousek and sanford 1986 cueva and medina 1988 bruijnzeel 1991 base cation are more mobil in soil solut than is p and therefor one might expect their greater loss as soil weather to creat the greatest nutrient shortag in old soil howev the iron and aluminumrich clay typic of old tropic soil readili fix p into unavail form and atmospher input of base cation are much higher than for p especi where sea salt aerosol are a major compon of deposit input chadwick and other 1999 henc phosphorus is general believ to be the most limit element in the major of tropic forest on older soil vitousek 1984 jordan 1985 herbert and fown 1995 and has been call the master regul of biolog activ walker and syer 1976 chadwick and other 1999 howev direct manipul studi of nutrient limit in lowland tropic rainforest are rare longterm fertil in hawaiian rain forest have shown that product and decomposit on old soil are clear limit by p avail vitousek and farrington 1997 hobbi and vitousek 2000 crew and other 1995 howev while the data from the hawaiian studi are high inform these are isol island ecosystem that contain a high depauper biota therefor the pattern seen here may or may not hold true in high diverseand often time far older continent tropic forest for the most part the widespread belief that p is the most common limit element in mainland tropic forest is larg base on indirect attempt to assess nutrient limit such as foliar element ratio compar vitousek 1984 vitousek and other 1988 again such data strong suggest that p is an import constraint but direct test of this hypothesi are scarc final most exist studi have focus primarili on plant respons to nutrient input with few except for exampl nziguheba and other 1988 near noth is known about link between p avail and microbi dynam microbi process are clear a key regul of nutrient cycl in ani system most of the annual nutrient requir of terrestri plant are suppli via the decomposit of organ matter by soil fungi and bacteria swift and other 1979 howev while nutrient suppli often limit plant growth microbi communiti in most ecosystem are typic thought to be more constrain by carbon avail than by nutrient gallardo and schlesing 1990 paul and clark 1997 wardl 1992 in the case of nitrogen addit of n to npoor system do not result in consist effect upon decompos communiti in some case n doe appear to stimul microbi growth but in mani other it addit has no effect or sometim even a negat effect for exampl fog 1988 erstrom and other 1983 nonetheless although microbi biomass itself is typic less than that of higher plant it nonnitrogen miner nutrient content in percent may be as much as 10 time higher and it may contain as much p per hectar as veget hayman 1975 also becaus there are multipl generat of growth by divers group of soil microorgan each year their annual demand and uptak of nutrient often exceed that of higher plant paul and clark 1997 cole and other 1977 thus although microbi respir andor growth are usual c limit the potenti for strong constraint by p on the miner of c substrat clear exist the object of this studi was to determin whether p limit microbi respir and decomposit in a lowland continent rain forest on veri old 44 million year soil we use both natur gradient in p fertil creat by soil of wide vari age combin with direct manipul of p and c suppli to the soil to test the effect of p avail on the decomposit of multipl form of carbon includ nativ dissolv organ c and soil organ c our overal hypothesi was that microbi util of carbon in ppoor soil would be constrain by p avail potenti creat feedback to even greater p limit to the plant communiti as well as veri differ storag time and fate for soil carbon than might be seen in more fertil site method studi site and sampl regim we address

lipson and other 1999 found that microbi respir respond exponenti follow glutam addit in an alpin soil with no indic that the util of glutam was limit by p ley and other 2000 found a similar result

fraction of the doc flux from litter into soil in tropic forest is labil and rapid util by microbi popul in addit the fact that the percent of doc respir in p sampl reach higher valu than in docon sampl can be explain in one of two way first the addit of excess p may enabl the microbi communiti to util more recalcitr form of the solubl c ad to the sampl altern excess p may facilit growth of the microbi biomass abov that observ in docon sampl and the turnov of this relat larger biomass pool may result in increas co2 product over the cours of the experi these data suggest that rapid decomposit of episod input of labil solubl c may be limit by p avail in addit our data suggest that the respons of the microbi communiti to input of labil c is extrem rapid and even follow relat larg flux of carbon into the soil respir rate return to background rate less than 24 h after the input event this is noteworthi given that multipl soil respir studi have shown that 80 of heterotroph respir is deriv from rapid turn over soil c pool that account for less than 5 of the total soil c reservoir townsend and other 1997 princip sourc of such labil c can includ turnov of the microbi biomass itself paul and clark 1997 exud from root biondini and other 1988 and solubl flux of organ compound through litterfal and into the soil mcdowel and liken 1988 in tem p this suggest that p is the critic element limit the util of this substrat in our tropic soil this was also observ follow salicyl addit howev the fact that salicyl lack n suggest that the clear p limit on the util of c was not induc by simultan n enrich in the glutam treatment in addit salicyl is more chemic complex than glutam result in the lower respir rate in figur 3 relat to figur 2 and it is miner by the same general pathway as breakdown product from lignin and detrit polyphenol again our data suggest that while the abil of the microbi communiti at of to miner this complex substrat is also limit by avail p the p respons we observ were not uniqu to a singl carbon compound the betweensit differ in the respons of the microbi communiti to addit of labil c were also observ in our field fertil experi in the prich mollisol

observ in the control or p treatment demonstr clear c limit of the microbi communiti in the oxisol soil howev sampl amend with glu p were signific higher than all other treatment at 3 6 and 9 h again suggest that c util at of was further limit by p avail one might expect that addit of a high labil compound such as glutam would be more like to produc a p respons by allevi ani c limit and focus the constraint upon nutrient suppli howev our data show that the decomposit of nativ ecosystem carbon was also clear limit by avail p to determin the net respons of soil respir stimul by the addit of doc

suggest that dure period of high c avail colimit by p could constrain the total respiratori flux of co2 from tropic soil below valu that would be expect if p were not limit and caus some fraction of labil c flush to remain within the ecosystem for longer period of time an increas in resid time for such c due to p constraint may increas the odd for it stabil in soil neff and asner 2001 andor it transport to aquat system to this point we have focus on the effect of p limit on the respons of the microbi communiti to input of exogen carbon much of which is labil these data clear demonstr colimit of the microbi communiti by both c and p howev our longerterm incub experi address the effect of p avail on the decomposit of nativ soc the fact that cumul co2 reach signific higher level than in control sampl suggest that the microbi communiti is clear p limit even in the absenc of more labil c input at least with respect to the decomposit of soil carbon after 3 day co2 respir in p treatment was approxim 50 higher than in control sampl after 7 day it was approxim 40 higher figur 6 the effect of p on longterm soil c decomposit dynam merit further investig to our knowledg these data offer the first clear evid of direct p limit to the activ of the soil microbi communiti in a moist tropic forest and have import implic for our understand of basic process in these system first becaus microb have high substrat affin rapid growth rate and high surfacetovolum ratio they are thought to outcompet plant root for nutrient rosswal 1982 chapin and other 1986 jackson and other 1989

excess c may be veri differ from that seen in ecosystem where microbi activ is primarili constrain by c alon our data suggest a somewhat counterintuit hypothesi in which we would predict higher rate of belowground c storag in respons to rise co2 level in more nutrientpoor ecosystem this predict is opposit to that for plant respons in which higher c storag is predict for more nutrientrich environ compar lloyd and farquhar 2000 we believ a key unknown for tropic forest is how plant on phosphoruspoor soil may respond to higher level of co2 given the high level of npp phillip and other 1998 field and other 1998 seen in forest on these soil despit the low nutrient level and the fact that n is often relat abund we believ signific increas in labil photosynth product and transport to the rhizospher are quit possibl in these forest again our data suggest that if such increas occur the more ppoor forest may display longerterm soil storag of the new carbon input final while our result suggest p limit to microbi process in a tropic rain forest are novel we suggest that the phenomenon may be preval in other tropic rain forest site and the possibl merit further investig for exampl although our data suggest that the of site is p poor relat to mani temper forest it is actual p rich compar to most tropic forest on older soil tabl 1 valu for labil soil p total soil p and litter p

of this work whoi contribut number 10932 here we explor the implic for the coexist of commerci fisheri and aquacultur in a particular ocean region we consid first what happen when aquacultur is introduc into a region where an openaccess fisheri is establish next we consid the effect of aquacultur on the price of quota in a fisheri in which a system of individu transfer quota itq has been implement final we develop a model to determin the optim longrun steadyst scale o f fish and aquacultur assum that the fisheri can be regul with tax or itq s we develop a numer exampl to illustr the

more space is devot to the altern use the cull of juvenil fish from a wild stock for growout in a cultur facil chang in the level of nutrient enrich and the risk of genet mix or displac and the spread of diseas these are the type of interact that have been highlight most in a negat sens by environment group cf goldburg elliott and naylor 2001 although the cultur o f one speci could affect the status of a rang of speci or the characterist of an entir ecosystem in this paper we focus main on the effect on a singl speci the most obvious type of competit between aquacultur and a fisheri is over physic occup of the ocean the site of an aquacultur facil such as a net pen longlin or seafloor growout may displac some form of commerci fish activ if the wild stock is unavail for harvest becaus of the failur of fish to migrat out of an area alloc for cultur then the effect carri capac m a y be reduc this issu is analog to the question of the diffus rate of a fish stock out of a marin reserv mullen 1989 as more space is alloc for aquacultur there may be both a smaller stock avail for fish and more congest in the area remain open for wild harvest these effect could lead to increas in the cost of fish on the other hand as more area is alloc for wild harvest the cost of aquacultur might increas if the potenti for achiev economi of scale is constrain anoth type of competit occur through the cull of juvenil from a wild stock to suppli aquacultur oper if the juvenil have not yet recruit to the spawn stock then cull could affect the carri capac of the fish stock as a consequ of recruit overfish cull has been propos for the cultur of bluefin tuna atlant sea scallop and summer flounder a final type of competit concern the extern effect of aquacultur on a fisheri first the releas of nitrogen from feed and fish wast might lead to nutri n t overenrich and eutroph particular in protect bay or small estuari second the potenti exist for the spread of diseas from cultur fish lead to declin in the wild stock third if the cultur fish are genet differ from wild fish there may be some potenti for affect the biolog fit of the wild stock if releas or escap occur in such a case aquacultur oper might be confin to a relat small area of the ocean with onli a minor physic displac of the fisheri the releas of nutrient diseas or genet alter fish howev might have effect that reach

the market we start with an examin of the competit between aquacultur and fish in the ocean aquacultur may also compet with wild harvest fisheri sole in the market this appear to be the situat in the world salmon market where lowcost aquacultur product may be caus the wild harvest fisheri in alaska to slump recent alaskan fisherm e n and processor have been attempt to differenti the product through a n unsuccess effort to certifi the wild harvest as organ this type of competit is an interest case in which technolog innov may lead to the displac of more tradit form of product with potenti import ramif for ecosystem health and social welfar we do not consid this case explicit in this paper although the essenc of the problem is found in a more general model that consid competit in the ocean as well as in the downstream market competit interact in the ocean we begin with a tradit product function for a wild harvest fisheri h f qxe 1 where hf is the level of land from the wild

as the avail stock declin we now begin to consid some of the econom aspect if we assum first that the fisheri and aquacultur product are ident and undifferenti in the market 2 this assumpt is critic to the analysi if it is known that the stock is distribut nonuniform the n it may be possibl to site aquacultur oper in such a way as to reduc the likelihood of impact on the fisheri mani jurisdict

surplus moreov the economi conceiv might benefit more even if somewhat less fish is produc by aquacultur for two reason the openaccess ineffici would be reduc or remov and aquacultur produc might earn surplus anoth import consider is what happen to the commerci fish fleet ostens there is no chang in produc surplus for fishermen becaus resourc rent are fulli dissip in openaccess equilibrium as the

it is also conceiv that the cost of fish will be an increas function of the space alloc to aquacultur for exampl becaus of gear conflict or increas congest if this is true then increas in s would tend

competit or complementari as an exampl of the latter hickman 1996 describ the merger of technolog from a wild harvest fisheri and aquacultur to undertak spat collect growout seab seed and dredg harvest in the new zealand southern sea scallop fisheri more frequent howev the two use are competit and user conflict could grow as aquacultur is increas look to as a sourc of suppli of seafood protein we develop a framework for improv our understand about these interact our hope is that with this improv understand we may be abl to manag fisheri resourc more effici and mitig potenti user conflict we show first that the commerci fisheri equilibrium stock size declin as more ocean space is devot to aquacultur when the fisheri is open access it may be optim for aquacultur to displac the fisheri even when aquacultur is produc a differ speci this result depend upon the size of consum surplus for the product of the two use and the fact that rent are dissip in the open access fisheri under the right condit the entri of aquacultur also could forc wild harvest fishermen to exit the fisheri impli that there may be consider polit opposit to aquacultur in an establish fisheri even if it is manag for maximum econom yield we consid the natur of the tradeoff between a rightsbas fisheri with right to quota and aquacultur with right to geograph space where the fisheri has preemin right the relationship between the valu of quota and the effect carri capac which may vari with the scale of aquacultur develop defin a minimum compens schedul for quota holder assum that the fish stock is uniform distribut over the fisheri we develop a framework to analyz the tradeoff between a wild harvest fisheri and aquacultur occur in the same region defin by the fisheri and sell into the same market in the framework aquacultur affect the fisheri carri capac and suppli a portion of the market the framework can be use to identifi the econom optim scale of both aquacultur and a commerci fisheri our result suggest that when aquacultur exert a signific negat impact on the fisheri the econom optimum often is associ with a corner solut of the model ie the region should be alloc exclus for either aquacultur or commerci fish and the coexist of the two use is suboptim use baselin paramet for a hypothet case involv fluke in rhode island sound we were unabl to find a superior equilibrium solut involv the coexist of both use in general if the net benefit from aquacultur exceed those from commerci fish then it is econom optim to replac the fisheri with aquacultur and vice versa we note that econom optim adjust along the path to equilibriumor what is even more like polit accomod could well lead to a situat where both use coexist further we have abstract from the real world where other use includ nonmarket use such as recreat fish and ecosystem conserv should enter into alloc decis with modifi paramet valu we examin intern steadyst solut to consid what happen when both use coexist the framework show that the optim a l valu of the control and state variabl are most sensit to the choke price and to both the unit cost and margin product of aquacultur we find counterintuit that the optim scale of aquacultur expand and optim commerci fish effort contract when the unit cost of aquacultur increas or when the margin product of aquacultur decreas this result is due to the interact between the dynam margin cost of aquacultur and those associ with the wild harvest fisheri an import question for futur research concern the generaliz of this result to realworld exampl of aquaculturefisheri interact 14 this condit can be interpret as requir that the margin increas in product of aquacultur with respect to s must exceed the margin loss in product for the wild

livestock product intern fund for agricultur develop ifad and food and agricultur organ of the unit nation n 2000 the share of african cassava product use as livestock feed is probabl underestim becaus cassava root and leav are fed to sheep goat and pig on smallscal farm in the cassava produc area either in fresh or cutanddri form nweke et al 2002 cassava product sheep and rear are high complementari becaus cassava process is carri out around home and sheep goat and chicken are fed byproduct of cassava process african cassava pellet are present not competit in european livestock feed market becaus of the high cost of product and transport within africa and europ and becaus africa has been an unreli supplier of pellet philip 1973 the rise cost of grain on the contin due to weather induc fluctuat high foreign debt and currenc devalu has forc a number of countri in africa to look inward for altern to maiz particular for it livestock industri in 1985 the govern of nigeria ban the import of maiz and compel livestock feed mill to look for local crop sourc such as cassava as a result the proport of total cassava product use as livestock feed increas from 310 percent from 1985 to 1990 nstat the nigeria feed mill industri has therefor adjust their facil to util cassava chip as long as the price of cassava is competit present price consider keep the usag of cassava low in the african livestock industri howev with higher product expect from improv varieti and cost save product and process technolog a surplus is anticip that could lower the farm price of cassava this scenario has led to grow interest among govern author the privat sector and research in africa on the improv of process and util of cassava for it livestock industri current face with a limit suppli

import maiz for this purpos in africa the scenario of usag vari among differ countri of subsaharan africa in west africa nigeria provid an interest case of how govern polici can influenc the use of cassava as a livestock feed in 1985 the govern of nigeria ban the import of maiz and compel livestock feed mill to look for local crop sourc such as cassava as a result the proport of total cassava product use as livestock feed increas from 310 percent from 1985 to 1990 though the ban on maiz import was lift cassava usag in the feed mill industri in nigeria continu howev due to a sharp rise in

who mill this into powder this process releas a lot of dust from the cassava dure mill and an appreci quantiti is therebi lost level of inclus of cassava in poultri feed is between 510 percent in nigerian feed mill and such mix includ full fat soya to ensur reduct of dust in such compound feed as an altern palm oil is ad on farm that mix their own feed to reduc dusti a cheaper and cost effect method for process cassava into chip and pellet has been develop at the intern institut for tropic agricultur tew and bokanga 2001 this involv harvest the cassava root wash and chip with a motor or manual driven chipper befor sundri on cement floor with turn twice daili use a rake this procedur elimin the peel cost this product is competit with maiz in the livestock feed industri as it is market at about 60 percent of the price of maiz the cassava chip can also be mix with shred and similar dri cassava leav mix in a 41 ration cassava root meal leav mill and pellet use a manual or motor driven pellet the pellet process has been simplifi by elimin the need for dri befor pellet in this most recent techniqu the wash unpeel cassava root is grate dewat and pass straight into the pellet where it is steam and the result hot pellet are sundri or oven dri the product is not onli cost effect to the feed miller as compar with maiz but a cottag industri can be profit sustain on this product which can be establish at the farm gate rural level it should be note that african cassava chip and pellet are not competit in european livestock feed market becaus of the high cost of product and transport in africa and from africa the recent experi of cassava chip product and export in ghana is an exampl africa has been an unreli supplier of pellet phillip 1973 accord to nweke et al 2002 the product of cassava in africa is notori unstabl becaus of weather induc fluctuat in food product africa unstabl suppli of cassava discourag european buyer who have a long histori of reli on more stabl asian and latin american supplier africa cassava product are also low in qualiti becaus of the ineffici tradit process method 30 63 use of cassava as anim feed to enhanc food secur in collabor with nation programm the intern institut for tropic agricultur iita has develop high yield and stabl cassava line and mani nation cassava improv programm in subsaharan africa have releas improv cassava varieti result from iita work higher product is therefor be record in mani african countri with nigeria becom the world lead cassava produc the increas in cassava product need to be match with diversif of usag of this root crop beyond it tradit role of be a stapl food on the contin the cycl of glut which follow excess product of cassava in nigeria and other countri in africa is a result of lack of altern market for this root crop cassava trade need to be boost to ensur that farmer can earn adequ incom from it to empow them econom sustain the product system and enhanc food secur on the contin the develop of new and altern use and product from cassava is therefor critic to it transform from a stapl food to becom a livestock feed compon and industri raw materi altern use for cassava exist in it transform into novel food livestock feed starch ethanol and pharmaceut product among these altern livestock feed appear to be the most promis becaus of the follow reason the standard requir for feed grade cassava product are not as stringent as for other product the possibl of packag technolog afford and practic at the farm gate level for livestock feed cassava product are high promis with anim protein consumpt project to increas on the contin there is tremend potenti for growth of the anim feed industri which is the main compon of cost in livestock product the possibl of cassava play a vital role in the suppli of feed ingredi to the industri is also not doubt avail of maiz which is the main energi sourc in compound livestock feed is be threaten as mani african nation cannot afford import of maiz due to huge foreign debt and currenc devalu local product of maiz is also hamper by escal cost of fertil and unfavour weather condit in mani african countri the need for cassava as an altern energi sourc becom imper in order to ensur adequ energi suppli in livestock compound and supplement ration with improv product surplus cassava is anticip in mani african countri and this can lower farm price for cassava product as cassava is essenti an energi sourc it is necessari for cassava farmer to earn incom to enabl them to purchas other feed like cereal and puls among other to ensur balanc nutrient intak and maintain a healthi household failur to expand the cassava market at the rural level to livestock feed product will hamper the socioeconom status of cassava farm populac and therefor erod their food secur thus transform of cassava into livestock feed ingredi therefor becom imper to prevent malnutrit and poverti among rural household which constitut over 90 percent of cassava produc on the contin 31 7 strateg intervent for cassava in livestock product in western eastern central and southern africa identif of gap opportun and constraint 71 african countri are at differ stage of transform of cassava from a famin reserv crop through stapl food cash crop and last industri raw materi and usag for livestock feed accord to nweke et al 2002 cosca studi in six african countri show that nigeria the lead world produc of cassava is the most advanc and is now pois to move to the stage of use cassava for livestock feed and industri raw materi for this transform to occur it is necessari to identifi market to absorb the increas in cassava product the wide spread adopt of tms varieti and the result increas in yield have shift the problem of the nigerian cassava industri from suppli product to demand issu such as find new use for cassava in livestock food and other industri inde while nigeria has move it cassava industri from a rural stapl food to the urban and food export stage a cycl of glut excess cassava has occur everi four year in the industri in the last decad it was note by the director of the feder depart of agricultur in nigeria in earli 2001 that cassava produc were lose money becaus of a glut in the market and declin cassava price nweke et al 2002 therefor there is a need for further diversif of cassava usag in nigeria the proport of cassava use in the livestock industri increas after the govern ban the import of maiz in 198586 and feed mill were forc to use cassava cassava was attract becaus it was cheaper than maiz while the expertis to util this root crop is establish in the feed mill industri the price of cassava has escal in recent time due to it scarciti follow the period of glut henc the quantiti in use for feed has declin consider to 5 percent of total product in recent time cost is therefor a major factor to take into consider in substitut cassava for maiz in livestock ration in studi from various countri the report level of the price of cassava as a proport of the price of maiz to make cassava competit obtain from divoir nigeria thailand and zimbabw indic a rang between 60 and 75 percent of the price of maiz low cost process technolog therefor need to be adopt in recent studi in nigeria by tew and bokanga 2001 whole unpeel cassava root and leav were wash shred sundri and mill prior to their be pellet in a ratio of four part of cassava root meal to one part of cassava leaf meal the high cost of peel of cassava root which is a major constraint in cassava process is thus elimin it should be note that even unpeel root are process and export from thailand into the european union on the other hand almost all the cassava flour adopt by feed miller in nigeria is from the peel storag root ghana is also at the third stage of the cassava transform process as classifi by nweke et al 2002 inde it had embark on an export of cassava chip and pellet to the european union within the last decad this project is threaten by the high cost of product transport irregular and quantiti of product unless the cost of cassava product drop consider to about us20 as obtain in south africa the competit of cassava in the export market will not be realiz 32 in divoir tiemoko 1992 note that the recommend price of 75 percent cassava cost relat to maiz is rare met as the price paid for cassava is general high and often higher than the price of maiz under such condit it seem that the opportun cost of cassava for human consumpt exceed it valu for human food with the introduct of improv tms varieti in divoir the higher product and surplus product will justifi it inclus in commerci livestock ration similar report from liberia ravindran and kenkpen 1992 confirm that almost all the cassava harvest is process into various form for human consumpt largescal util of cassava as anim feed is onli practic at the govern agricultur research station cari higher product of cassava may lead to it increas util as anim feed in this regard cari has alreadi releas onto the market some anim feed formul base on cassava root as the major energi sourc in east africa unit republ of tanzania and uganda indic that present the proport of cassava use for livestock feed constitut 03 and 27 percent of total product respect nstat similar export of cassava from unit republ of tanzania stood at 164 000 metric tonn in 1991 and declin to 15 000 metric tonn in the year 2000 lekul and sarwatt 1992 report that in unit republ of tanzania in area where cassava is a stapl food there is alway an excess of product which is sold to the nation mill corpor most of which is export present it is onli when grain are in veri short suppli that some amount of cassava chip are includ in feed anoth problem is that cassava is produc in dri area where intens livestock product is not practic also the high price of cassava make it use in livestock feed uneconom the need for improv costeffect process techniqu to produc cheap cassava chip and pellet for the local and export market is a major constraint in unit republ of tanzania with 556 000 tonn or 27 percent usag of cassava for anim feed in uganda nstat the countri stand as have the highest percentag usag as anim feed not onli in the region but in the whole of subsaharan africa as report by otimnap donor interest in the introduct of the tms varieti in uganda was spark by the appear and rapid spread of cassava mosaic in the late 1980s by the year 2000 80 000 ha of the mosaic resist tms varieti were under cultiv the higher product of cassava and it competit price to maiz explain the high percentag usag of this root crop for livestock feed in uganda ethiopia kenya and the sudan have no record usag of cassava for livestock feed the higher livestock densiti to human popul in these countri as compar with unit republ of tanzania and uganda tabl 11 show tremend potenti for use of cassava for livestock feed if the improv tms varieti are promot in these countri sanda and methu 1992 report that in the high cassava produc area of western and coastal region of kenya excess cassava is not alway ferment befor be sundri these region also have notabl household dairi unit one or two exot breed be use for milk product supplement feed with sweet potato root and leav in this region increas the profit margin of milk produc from almost 90 to 1 000 kenyan shill per week complet substitut of maiz meal with cassava meal in the dairi ration in western kenya has also been demonstr to be econom and associ with a reduct in feed cost of kenyan shill 328 us10 per tonn cassava root and leav therefor have high potenti for usag in this region and by 33 extens in other cattl produc area of subsaharan africa where cassava can be profit cultiv in central africa cameroon show great potenti as it util of cassava for livestock feed has been maintain at about 10 percent of product between 1991 and 2000 also use of other root steadi at about 20 percent of product within the same period the competit price of cassava and other root crop notabl sweet potato to that of maiz in cameroon might explain higher percentag util than for maiz which stand at 5 000 metric tonn as compar with 150 000 metric tonn for cassava in 2000 tabl 20 and 21 in chad percentag cassava usag is also signific at 5 percent of product or 17 000 metric tonn with the high cattl and poultri popul in chad and cameroon high potenti exist for exploit cassava usag for feed also export of dri chip hold high promis in chad and other arid and semiarid region of africa due to intens solar energi which

toxin in cassava product can be veri import in cassava chip produc as this vari with the period of dri and cleanli of the environ method of dri as develop by the post harvest unit of iita recommend optimum chip size 3 x 7 mm and load capac 5 kgm2 on clean concret floor which can reduc moistur content from 6070 to 1314 percent a day dure the dri season shred of cassava storag root and leav and constant turn can ensur dri to less than 14 percent in 72 hour dure the wet season there is howev a need to test this under vari environment condit 93 market of feed and livestock product the price competit of cassava product as a replac for maiz or wheat in livestock feed remain the major bottleneck to it widespread adopt in domest and export market experi from south africa show the feasibl of use modern agronom techniqu with suppli of input under contract arrang to produc cassava at us20tonn as compar with an averag price of us50tonn with tradit cultur practic in nigeria the reduct of product cost is therefor primari to expand the market for cassava usag in the livestock industri farm gate process is also import to reduc transport cost therebi transport dri chip and pellet rather than the fresh storag root which also deterior rapid between harvest and transport to process site process whole unpeel storag root into anim feed will reduc the cost of peel a studi by tew and bokanga 2001 show the price of cassava product from unpeel storag root and leav to be 40 percent cheaper than maiz the poor storabl of dri cassava product also limit it usag to short period when price are competit and cassava is produc in abund chip are store for not more than three month by commerci feed miller in nigeria extend the shelf life will allow it procur and storag when price are low and can be competit use with escal price of maiz the need for promot of appropri cassavabas formul process technolog and livestock husbandri system to optim perform and profit of cassavabas feed in differ agricultur set for mix croplivestock and livestock farmer in subsaharan africa cannot be overemphas escal price of livestock product in the last decad have been larg due to scarciti and astronom spiral cost of livestock feed ingredi which constitut between 60 and 80 percent of cost of product in commerci livestock product system cheaper cassavabas feed can therefor stem this tide of anim protein scarciti and it chronic defici on the contin 94 polici issu cassava is at differ stage of transform in countri of subsaharan africa while it is still a stapl food in most countri it is present a cash crop for urban consumpt and food export notabl in ghana and nigeria to shift cassava to be a livestock feed for domest and export market the polici issu which need to be implement are as follow 52 cassava product need to be modern it tradit system of product in small hectarag cannot sustain an industri market there is a need to drive down the cost of cassava product per tonn in order to give this crop the price competit it requir in comparison with maiz and other cereal crop the need therefor is to recogn the relat neglect that cassava has had in comparison to cereal crop in term of research develop activ cassava product has been promot larg through special project sinc independ in mani countri rather than through the systemat improv of the product of the entir cassava food system it is import to adopt a polici wherebi african and donor attent is focus on support for the entir cassava product process and util system to acceler cassava transform to an industri crop in subsaharan africa while the debt burden and unfavour currenc exchang in mani african countri have influenc govern polici of look inward for it food and feed raw materi suppli the inconsist polici of ban and unban import of noncassava food has affect the cassava economi in mani african countri a fundament problem is the need to remov subsidi on import maiz and wheat in order to provid a level ground for cassava to compet in the food and feed industri the vari level of transform of cassava in countri of subsaharan africa creat a need for inject of vari technolog in differ region in west africa particular in nigeria and ghana cost save devic exist for chip and pellet cassava into anim feed although there is still the need to perfect and dissemin these technolog as develop through the iita ibadan nigeria there is also the need in these countri to diffus labour save technolog for product and harvest of cassava diffus of inform on the suitabl of whole unpeel cassava root for livestock feed against the use of peel root will reduc labour cost and drive down cost of cassava chip and pellet for the feed industri the adopt of whiteskin and thinpeel varieti will also enhanc this cost reduct strategi in other region of subsaharan africa there is a serious need for diffus of inform on mechan product and process diffus of inform on cassavabas feed formul and onfarm data on perform of livestock and fish rear on these diet need to be wide dissemin and demonstr on the contin technolog of incorpor of cassava leav into feed also need wide dissemin develop the bulk system and collect centr for cassava suppli to industri is serious hamper by poor rural infrastructur there is a dire need for improv of rural road and transport system in most subsaharan african countri develop of inform technolog is critic in access market inform local and global cassava farmer therefor need the internet connect to enabl them to take advantag of domest and export market opportun the erron notion that cassava is a women crop has been recent debunk by nweke et al 2002 cassava need to be seen as a crop that provid opportun for poverti allevi for both men and women inde as cassava becom industri both men and women becom visibl in the mechan product and process scene 53 it is therefor necessari to take a holist approach and introduc modern system for product and process of cassava to drive down it cost and affect it competit with cereal in the livestock feed industri of subsaharan africa 95 capac build the histori of cassava develop in africa show the dearth of scientif capac that has span the period between 1935 when cassava research began at the amani research station in unit republ of tanzania and the present in differ research and develop centr of the contin the lack of incent and serious underfund of most research station on the contin had dampen the enthusiasm of the few research commit to cassava develop yet due to the longterm growth cycl of the cassava plant relat to maiz breed research in particular take a longer time for cassava livestock research and adopt on the contin has also suffer a similar fate a world bank studi in nigeria on the impact of develop livestock technolog on their adopt by farmer shaib aliyu and bakshi 1997 reveal that while there were numer crop product technolog adopt and dissemin in the 25 year of the world bank assist agricultur develop project adp oper in nigeria onli within the last decad was the issu of livestock technolog address to a limit extent the rate of adopt of develop livestock technolog was also disastr low similar stori were obtain in most other african countri oper the world bank assist adp scheme due to the low ratio of extens agent to farmer on the contin coupl with underfund of extens servic poor rural road and mass illiteraci develop of human capac for cassava product process and market has been great hamper capac build for cassava develop on the contin must therefor take cognis of the need for research extensionist and practition ie cassava farmer and processor and would be industrialist the need to institut privatel initi in capac build is underscor by recent experi in south america where the clayuca consortium serv as an arrowhead for privatel initi in cassava develop the need to target cooper farmer and processor of cassava in capac build is also critic to it industri 96 environment consider tradit process of cassava into food in subsaharan africa is often associ with the discharg of larg amount of water hydrocyan acid and organ matter in the form of peel and sieviat from pulp as wast product these are often improp dispos and when they are carri out on a largescal as in commerci garri product the result wast are often left in mound which generat a high offens odour and are rather unsight cassava process is therefor general consid to contribut signific to environment pollut and deplet of water resourc as they contamin surfac water particular dure the dri season of the year tradit cassava process in africa is usual carri out around homestead and close associ with rear of sheep goat chicken and at time pig these stock 54 therefor consum a substanti part of these wast in the form of peel sieviat and often leav indigen stock rear around homestead therefor help to reduc environment pollut from cassava wast it is also a common sight to find roam indigen cattl sheep and goat aggreg around larg mound of cassava peel in cassava food process centr consum some part of the generat wast an organ collect of cassava wast particular the peel and pulp wast and their proper process into dri cassava product can serv as use supplementari feed particular for rumin in subsaharan africa inde this is the most practic form of util cassava for livestock feed in scenario where cassava storag root are still insuffici as human food cassava process into commerci livestock feed present involv peel of cassava storag root and sundri while the peel are left to rot the dri of the storag root into chip doe not entail discharg of water which is remov by solar dri henc the risk of cyanid discharg into surfac of water is also elimin and such process sight are less unsight the more recent introduct of produc cassava chip and pellet from whole unpeel storag root with incorpor of leav tew and bokanga 2001 elimin the problem of wast dispos as unpeel storag root and leav are shred and sundri this is therefor an environment friend method of cassava process and reduct of wast dispos problem it is also import to note that process of cassava into pellet in thailand often involv incorpor of pulp wast particular from the starch industri adopt of this in africa will help reduc wast in food and starch industri moreov wast from ethanol industri contain protein rich yeast contain byproduct these are often left to discharg in surround of industri use cassava for ethanol product as in nigeria these protein rich byproduct can serv as veri use complement to energi rich cassava storag root in ration and supplement for differ livestock speci if the wast are proper har through dri and proper storag use of cassava byproduct for livestock feed can therefor be a major mean of recycl wast into wholesom livestock feed in africa the advocaci for the use of cassava leav as anim feed is challeng by the fact that in cassava product system the leav are usual left to rot in the field in this case return leav and stem to the soil is the essenti first step in prevent nutrient deplet and maintain soil fertil inde in area where leav and stem are util and remov from the field nutrient remov can doubl or tripl depend on whether it is nitrogen phosphorus or potassium that is consid nifad 2000 howev where anim manur is avail it is recommend to appli about 5 tonnesha manur togeth with chemic fertil high in potassium where chemic fertil are not avail or too cost it is recommend to appli 710 tonnesha of manur in combin with wood ash mix farm system involv rear of livestock and cultiv of cassava can therefor be an environment friend and fertil sustain system as the manur from livestock can be veri use in maintain soil fertil while the cassava leav peel and pulp wast or even the storag root can serv as valuabl livestock feed due cognis must be taken of the hydrocyan acid discharg from cassava food process industri sheep and goat drink from cassava pollut water has result in some mortal it is therefor import to ensur that cyanid that is liber dure cassava process especi in process that creat larg amount of squeez juic should be dilut or store in such a manner that cyanid concentr is reduc befor 55 discharg into the environ inde model for util wast water from garri industri present advoc recycl into starch factori where the residu starch can still sediment and be collect befor discharg of the effluent into the environ it should be note that consider cyanid can be lost even if storag of such wast water is for a short time 97 issu for further research and develop while the paltri use of cassava for livestock feed in africa is of concern in the quest to develop this root crop as an industri raw materi the proport of wast from cassava product present generat in some countri call for a closer studi of cassava and explor of it potenti in such place the proport of usag for feed in cameroon madagascar and uganda surpass that for nigeria between 1991 and 2000 yet these countri are not recogn for their potenti to use the crop for livestock feed that of cameroon is more interest as the use of cassava at 150 000 tonn annual far exceed the use of maiz which stand at 5 000 tonn the exampl in nigeria is much public though it rise from 3 percent usag to 10 percent between 1985 and 1990 and subsequ fall to 5 percent between 1991 and 2000 has littl explan it is probabl due to a combin of factor of polici competit price and popul of livestock particular poultri dure these period the ban on maiz in 1984 subsequ popular cassava for livestock feed howev from 1990 noncompetit price of cassava and the sharp drop in commerci poultri popul from 20 to 8 million reduc usag from 10 to 5 percent between 1991 and 2000 countri studi therefor need to be initi in these place with some potenti as indic to further exploit it usag for livestock feed and understand it dynam as model for other african countri product from cassavabas feed need to be studi in comparison to maizebas one in these countri in order to obtain comprehens inform on cassava competit and market a review of polici to enhanc competit of cassava as compar with maiz also need to be undertaken in mani african countri as cereal import is still high subsid due to the cultur practic for cassava product in most african countri be produc on small hectarag in tradit farm system with minim input and implement the cost of product per tonn is much higher and the volum that can be suppli for industri usag is rather restrict compar with modern product system as present adopt on a 5 000 ha cassava farm in south africa for competit process of cassava in livestock feed for domest and export market modern cost and labour save product method need to be adopt in subsaharan africa there is therefor the need to develop such practic similar the develop of organ bulk and collect centr to feed livestock and other industri need to be put into place cassava process method for the product of chip and to a lesser extent pellet in subsaharan africa are at stage of infanc product of chip is by cut into slice with cutlass or a sharp knife and sundri on bare ground or rocki area in most instanc the cassava is also usual peel thus increas cost of product the qualiti of such chip also hard meet the requir as indic for the european union market and compromis standard for domest feed mill formul becaus contamin and microtoxin are usual at unaccept level process techniqu 56 develop particular in collabor studi between the iita and the univers of ibadan need to be introduc for adopt on the contin wherebi chipper and shredder are use and hygien condit are maintain in dri area use of unpeel storag root as in these report studi will elimin peel cost and incorpor of leav will enhanc the protein and carotenoid content of such product pellet product develop from local fabric pellet machin are still of inferior qualiti to those accept for export market as soft rather than hard pellet are obtain and the starch is still rather powderi rather than be gelatin yet the cost of import pellet still remain unafford for cassava farmer and processor in most instanc the need to sourc afford and suitabl pellet for accept cassava pellet product remain to be address on the contin the process of first produc dri chip befor pellet still rais the problem of remil and rehydr befor pellet techniqu need to be develop to elimin the need for dri fresh grate or shred root befor pellet to reduc cost and enhanc product effici the need to develop effici dryer for chip and pellet must also be urgent address particular for climat with consider wet season which coincid with region of abund of cassava cassava chip and pellet from africa have poor storabl as microbi infest set in within three month of storag in most instanc the prolong of shelf life for cassava product will expand their use particular in period of maiz scarciti in the livestock industri cassava cyanid scare is still a problem for it adopt in commerci feed mill peel and sundri elimin most of the cyanid to level below the accept 100 ppm in most instanc method of chip and dri as well as varieti differ affect this with the advocaci for use of unpeel storag root for product of cassava chip process method need to be standard and rapid easi method for cyanid assay need to be dissemin to ascertain accept cyanid level particular in dri product livestock product system in africa are still larg extens yet the demonstr use of cassava for livestock feed particular in the european union is for the intens rear stock feed system to incorpor cassava as a supplement in extens and semiintens system need to be develop to take advantag of the need for energi suppli in the usual malnourish stock of cattl sheep and goat rear in such system the develop and promot of cassava plantbas formul for differ livestock and fish speci in differ countri and agroecolog set of africa is a desideratum if cassava is wide adopt in african livestock feed system the manipul and promot of the recommend ration will go a long way to impact this onfarm feed trial to evalu the perform and econom valu of such ration need to be carri out extens on the contin in order to win the confid of the commerci feed miller and livestock farmer to adopt them their wide public after adequ test will enhanc it dissemin and adopt establish of pilot project to demonstr the feasibl of such cassavabas feed system need to be institut in differ set to enhanc their adopt 57 in a report of the global cassava strategi plan spencer et al 1992 comment on the african contin thus industrialist and entrepreneur often shi away from use cassava in their applic becaus of the absenc of a local exampl to follow and uncertainti of success africa therefor need catalyst which will facilit cassava feed entrepreneur and champion who will protect the cassava industri it is onli with this strategi that cassava can take it right place in livestock feed on the african contin 98 enhanc of food secur cassava play a major role in effort to allevi the african food crisi becaus of it effici product of food energi yearround avail toler to extrem stress condit and suitabl to present farm and food system in africa in spite of net food import in africa as from the earli 1970s and food product grow at half the popul growth rate from 19701985 cassava product in africa has increas tremend in the last four decad with africa produc half of this and nigeria replac brazil as the lead cassavaproduc countri in the world accord to nweke et al 2002 the factor respons for the dramat expans of cassava in africa are the introduct of the mechan grater and garri prepar method that have transform cassava into a dri cereal for urban consumpt rapid popul growth and poverti which have encourag consum to search for a cheaper sourc of calori high yield tms varieti that have boost farm level cassava yield by 40 percent in ghana and nigeria and biolog control of the cassava mealybug yet cassava still remain a tradit stapl rather than an industri crop and it is be discourag as a low protein food rather than focuss on help smallhold diversifi their crop through industri and increas rural incom so that famili can purchas proteinrich food to supplement their diet to satisfi these need cognis should be taken of the problem of glut that usual follow bumper harvest of this crop due to it be use almost entir for tradit human food diversifi the use of cassava into other commod in it transform chain requir standard specif that will make the cassava product compet favour in domest and export market yet these standard can hard be met with farm gate process as the rural infrastructur and capabl on rural

not as stringent as those for other industri raw materi commod the requir equip includ shredder chipper and dryer can be fabric to fit into smallscal enterpris near farm communiti such dri product can then be transport to urban feed miller or other domest or export market encourag farm gate process of cassava will therefor not onli 58 reduc the cost of cassava product due to reduc transport cost but will also guarante direct earn to cassava farmer who hitherto have to contend with ridicul low price offer by middleperson who also have to contend with high transport cost of fresh cassava storag root to urban market process of cassava into dri feed raw materi will also enabl storag which is not possibl with fresh storag root unless they leav this in the ground until need some countri in africa current use between 6 and 27 percent of it cassava product for livestock feed the proport use and absenc of use in mani african countri is relat to it noncompetit price relat to maiz which is becom scarc for the industri due to other compet need yet cassava can occupi this gap if it feed product are made cheaper through farm gate process to reduc transport cost of fresh storag root from

four major compon first the drive forc of the agricultur transit process and urban are review from an histor perspect second the problem aris from urbanrur relat in the context of food suppli are

larg metropolis or urban agglomer 1 there are now over thirti urban agglomer in develop countri and most of those are locat in asia this develop pose a tremend challeng for the agricultur sector and

safeti standard this paper analys the major issu of food product and process in a world characteris by a constant decreas of public invest in agricultur from an asian perspect the empir evid provid

although the definit differ most countri call settlement between 2500 and 25000 peopl urban area regardless of the criteria use the number of peopl live in larg citi is on the rise world develop report 19992000 veri often the major of the urban popul live in the capit citi eg bangkok manila jakarta the share of agricultur in gdp is declin as a result of higher overal growth rate in the

henc a dollar invest in industri develop is expect to yield higher return than one invest in agricultur for econom reason industri take place in urban area where the agglomer of product factor such as labour and infrastructur as well as the output of market generat economi of scale the accumul of a grow share of the popul in urban agglomer has generat a polit economi where the agricultur sector

produc more to innov to adopt new technolog and to invest the pressur that the urban popul can put on govern effect has result in a cheap food polici that invari has brought about a conflict of

strategi murphi et al 1989 the specif role of agricultur was not mention by and larg develop polici suffer from an urban bias that has an empir as well as a theoret base empir food product has outpac popul growth result in declin food price on the theoret side the root for a bias toward agricultur is the arthur lewi dual economi theori lewi 1958 his model is base on the assumpt that the major role of the agricultur sector in a develop economi is to suppli surplus labour to a grow industri sector this theori reli on the percept that agricultur is character by ineffici and low labour product invest in agricultur was regard as invest in poverti modern agricultur on the other hand was assum to requir industri first onli through the process of industri would the tradit equitybas wage of a feudalist agricultur societi 1983 be replac by an econom price for labour ie one base on suppli and demand in the labour market of the industri sector rani and fei 1961 while the posit contribut of agricultur in earli phase of econom develop was recognis low price for agricultur product relat to industri product were believ to be a necessari precondit for rapid industri 1983 food price in countri where incom are low are wage good ie as peopl spend a larg share of their incom for food the price of food determin their true earn while the earli industri strategi work well in some countri it fail in other to date there are larg differ among asian countri the share of agricultur in gdp has declin in all countri taken into consider in this paper world bank 2000 howev this declin doe not

fring of the metropoli is a respons to some kind of institut failur the grow disconnect between food product and food consumpt and better inform access has it cost consum are more like to overreact in case of report food scandal and misus of agricultur technolog if they littl knowledg of agricultur product process producerconsum communic can be more effect if consum are well inform and can thus provid reliabl signal to produc and vice versa clear citi author can play a role in improv the inform environ by accept agricultur and food product as part of the citi life and by introduc institut to improv the situat agricultur is not and cannot be restrict to nonurban area post harvest and agroindustri develop in general are favour by urban despit claim that it doe allevi rural poverti as in the case of the starch industri in vietnam golletti and samman 1999 agricultur crop like certain type of veget are most profit grown at the urban fring the develop of technolog that take into account natur resourc environ and human health is a prioriti research area local govern polici can stimul the develop and adopt of sustain technolog by creat a favour polici framework that discourag the use of potenti harm technolog such as excess use of chemic pesticid likewis govern can support agroindustri by avoid unnecessari bureaucrat procedur and take into account locat theori aspect in land use plan urban migrat will continu to take place despit increas effort for rural develop therefor rural develop is not a substitut for the engag of citi author in agricultur and food issu rather the complementari relationship between urban and rural polici need to be more effect elabor and exploit clear from a citi perspect govern intervent is most need in the land market here econom incent such as tax rebat or tax relief can provid an incent to maintain land for agricultur purpos regulatori intervent such as agricultur zone and the public purchas or privat transfer of land develop right are other possibl to reduc the probabl of food insecur for the urban poor for exampl the revis of actual urban zone bylaw and the integr of urban agricultur in zone plan indic in which zone urban agricultur is allow can be implement also zone where certain type of farm will be prohibit due to special condit can be specifi exist farm unit especi in periurban area can be includ in citi develop

communiti group on a medium term leas for agricultur purpos purpos specif leasehold such periurban and inner citi green belt could be given a communiti titl to ensur that such open space remain in the public domain final citi author can reduc the negat effect of land specul by improv the inform environ eg by improv the dissemin of public inform on govern project in conclus the issu around food

doe forest manag affect carbon in forest soil if tree are harvest and the wood is use for fibr how long will the carbon in the wood remain out of the atmospher if we cannot answer question like these with certainti how should we grant credit for forestri activ that rais these kind of question cop6 and cop7 did not offer complet answer to these question but they did provid some basic guid principl

longerterm role of forestri as mitig cop7 and cop9 have gone a long way to answer some open question especi as they appli to the first commit period of the kyoto protocol 2008 to 2012 but technic issu and issu concern the treatment of forest in subsequ commit period remain complet open third the legal issu concern mitig through forest will overlap with the legal issu concern mitig and complianc general for exampl a parti may wish to set up a ghg emiss trade system that deal with all kind of sink and all kind of sourc from farm to factori not just forest as discuss in more detail in the third chapter of this paper countri will encount some legal issu that are uniqu to forest and other that appli to a broad rang of sourc and sink some legal issu may be seen as matter while other may be consid issu of properti law or law govern invest and financi transact fourth the direct of legisl will vari depend on the local legal system and institut a legal system that recogn social properti and

kind of problem are familiar to legisl drafter but ghg mitig may rais them in new context fifth the role of nation legisl in complianc is still unclear do countri realli need new law onli a few

with a more abstract concept than the present amount of carbon sequest in a forest the law must make clear who has the right to claim ownership when the forest sequest carbon to make a rough analog when a farmer sell fruit the buyer is onli interest in what fruit the farmer has to offer when the farmer plan for produc fruit the farmer must think about what land he may legal harvest perhap the land he own or those he has leas or those for which he has bought a right to harvest or perhap even public land from which anyon may come and gather fruit when a parti present evid of complianc to the unfccc secretariat the secretariat will be interest in how the sourc and sink have actual perform howev when a parti plan for complianc or when an individu plan to exploit sink to offset emiss to compli with a nation law the parti and individu will be concern about what sink they may legal claim they will want the law to clarifi who may claim to own the potenti for forest to sequest carbon who own the carbon sequest potenti of a forest the obvious answer is the owner of the forest howev the obvious answer is far from the onli possibl answer below are some possibl ownership system i the owner of the properti own the potenti and a the potenti doe not exist as a separ properti right the properti owner cannot sell or give it away independ of sell or give away the properti howev if the

if as in 1b the govern may transfer the properti right the new owner would also acquir the right to affect properti use 4 as in 1b abov but the nation govern hold the potenti as truste for the benefit

of the easement requir the land to be activ manag for conserv purpos the holder of the easement ordinarili cannot sell it or reap ani monetari gain from it but hold it strict to benefit the public usual the law onli allow the state or ngos dedic to conserv to acquir conserv easement a few unit state local govern recogn a fulli tradabl right to develop land properti owner in area mark for conserv cannot use their right to develop their own properti but they can sell the right to properti owner in area mark for develop owner that buy the right can or build more extens than neighbour who have not bought the tradabl right the intent of the system is to compens fair properti owner in the conserv zone for the restrict on their properti use the point of these exampl is that the univers of possibl model for carbon sequestr ownership and trade goe well beyond tradit notion of properti and market legisl drafter look for model may find them in tradit system of properti law or in innov system of mitig trade and offset of environment harm the choic of how to shape the natur of the properti right in carbon sequestr will depend on sever factor exist law and legal tradit will play a major role and may constrain the choic legisl and jurist usual prefer to appli exist pattern of law to new situat rather than to adopt radic innov for exampl in a countri that onli recogn easement or servitud that direct benefit other properti legisl may hesit to recogn a servitud that can be trade independ of a domin estat costa rica offer a concret exampl of this the countri has want to creat a properti interest in the natur of a conserv easement that would creat a legal right to prevent the subservi land from be develop or clear howev costa rican law onli recogn easement that benefit a specif domin estat the countri has adopt the minor fiction that a conserv easement is for the benefit of and so attach to nearbi reserv natur area anoth factor is the natur of the local economi in a countri with an unstabl currenc or poor develop market it will be impract to set up a nation system base on tradabl right howev a limit system grant credit to larg pollut that financ mitig project may be feasibl a third factor is the government capac to deal with abstract form of landownership in a countri where the govern find it difficult even to determin who own surfac right to a particular piec of land it would be unrealist to put in place a complex system of intang divis interest a fourth factor is the natur of the demand for carbon sequestr if the major goal of a countri is to encourag foreign govern to invest in forestbas mitig project and governmenttogovern deal are the desir outcom a system vest ownership of sequestr in the nation govern may be appropri if develop countri adopt law that encourag individu emitt of ghg to seek offset develop countri seek privat invest may wish to vest ownership of sequestr potenti in privat hand the ultim interpret of the kyoto protocol may affect the choic and desir of market mechan as well if the parti develop a system that promot transfer of mitig credit it will make market system more attract carbon ownership is not an abstract question for forest owner even without a larg market carbon valu may be substanti see box valuat carbon sequestr in irish forest industri emiss will probabl exceed kyoto commit consist of annual emiss reduct of approxim 154 mt co2 or 42 mt of carbon c forest establish sinc 1990 will fix 03 mt c per annum offset about 65 percent of project excess emiss and reduc carbon credit to be acquir in intern market by this amount at a market valu of per tonn of carbon in intern emiss trade these young irish forest alon would save the countri an outlay of about million annual or million over the commit

the state subtract from this amount an estim of carbon store on the site befor reforest to get the longterm net averag increas in carbon storag this choic appear to be a polici decis that the govern has made unilater without formal legisl although the legislatur recent gave the state board of forestri author to write regul govern forestri carbon offset oregon revis statut a question relat to is the size of the is unit do we use to describ the as discuss in the first chapter of this paper the cop seem to have answer this question by creat the remov unit rmu and a group of similar size perman as well as temporari unit to measur trade and complianc with protocol goal to promot trade and simplifi account countri should adopt these intern unit to describ size durat and time close relat to size are issu of durat and time govern and other organ may base oblig on annual or fiveyear cycl but forest cycl of growth harvest and decay extend over much longer period the rule for offset must reconcil these differ and deal with other complic of time for exampl can offset be measur in unit that fungibl combin time and mass is one tonn of carbon sequest for five year equival to five tonn fix in biomass for onli one year is five tonn fix for one year at the begin of a complianc period equival to five tonn fix for one year at the end of a complianc period and what about the nonperman natur of forest if govern grant carbon credit and financi award to forest owner for carbon increment in their forest will owner have to pay back when they harvest their forest or when the forest succumb to the next hurrican intern the parti have solv the problem of nonperman through the concept of temporari credit and carbon leas nation govern may adapt the solut or may seek altern that fit both intern requir and local need as exampl new zealand now propos carbon credit and market particip for domest afforest of protect forest that exclud futur harvest while the state of oregon is allow forestri offset in product forest base on expect averag sequestr over multipl harvest cycl transfer the abov discuss have begun to rais some of the legal issu that might aris regard transfer of ownership of a carbon sequestr potenti assum that the potenti can be own and transfer at all can it be transfer separ from the ownership of the land if landown a transfer the ownership of the potenti to buyer b can b forc a to manag the forest to maintain or enhanc the potenti can b enter the land and assess the potenti can b enter and activ manag the land if a then sell the under land to new owner c doe c bear ani oblig toward b can b transfer the ownership and all it entail to a stranger d can the govern forc a to transfer the potenti to the govern for public use these kind of question are common one in the world of properti transact the answer will depend on whether the govern recogn the potenti as a kind of properti subject to properti transact law or as someth that result from particular kind of behaviour subject to law regard contract if the potenti is transfer some issu of fraud prevent may aris the interest will be intang there may be no physic indic that someon other than the land occupi hold the interest beyond the paper or electron record of transfer held by the parti what would prevent an unscrupul owner from sell the same carbon sink potenti over and over to differ parti govern face similar problem with other incorpor properti right such as secur interest or usufructuari right the spectr of fraud even haunt transfer of the ownership of the whole properti the respons of govern has been to give notic to potenti buyer of who actual own the properti in it most basic form the notic may be littl more than a public ceremoni of transfer or a post sign declar ownership or the govern may creat a registri of properti interest and requir buyer or seller to enter sale in public record book in nation with welldevelop market and experienc regul the govern may wish to consid legisl in other area to promot transfer these area could includ insur brokerag bank and formal market structur insur encourag transfer by spread risk buyer of carbon sink potenti will face two kind of risk the first is that the seller doe not actual have author to transfer the sink potenti this could be so becaus the under land titl is flaw or becaus the seller has alreadi transfer the potenti to someon els a insur would research the ownership right and issu a polici that would pay out if the titl later prove flaw the second kind of risk is that the forest doe not serv as a sink owe to circumst beyond the control of the buyer or seller for exampl flood wind fire insect or diseas could strike the forest squatter could steal the tree or clear the land war or rebellion could destroy the forest or the govern could acquir the land legal for public purpos such as construct of a road insur might be will to write polici cover some of these kind of risk govern may choos to provid insur direct or to regul privat insur provid provid insur would be a form of subsidi to promot these kind of transact govern may regul insur to provid stabil to the insur market and to prevent fraud therebi make insur a more attract option for consum govern interest in promot sink insur through regul can probabl draw on their own experi in regul insur compani if the govern doe not have a domest insur industri alreadi it is unlik to generat one sole to cover ghg mitig transact an open market in ghg mitig potenti may allow peopl to earn money as mitig broker the role would be to link interest buyer with interest seller and otherwis to facilit sale to cite a wellknown exampl to demonstr the feasibl of ghg mitig brokerag the world bank has creat sever fund among them specif the biocarbon fund for sink project again the govern may wish to take the brokerag task on itself or it may wish to regul the profess of broker regul may take the form of licens train or bond requir govern will probabl find model for brokerag programm and law in their law concern sale of agricultur crop relat to brokerag is bank here will seller could transfer the right to their potenti to a mitig bank the bank would be a central place for those in need of mitig to come to buy credit depend on the system the bank could pay the seller for the mitig up front or could act more like a broker make some of the payment conting on sale bank could be govern or privat entiti if the govern allow privat bank it may want to regul them to reduc fraud or mismanag that could hurt buyer and seller mitig bank can function even if the law doe not recogn greenhous gas mitig potenti as a sever transfer properti right the wetland mitig bank found under the unit state clean water act are an exampl regul under that law can requir

implement risk and act of natur or third parti chang the forest human and natur hazard moreov improv in our knowledg of forest scienc could chang our understand of how much carbon a particular forest sequest if that happen whether the estim of carbon sequest goe up or down who gain or lose who bear the risk may depend on the natur of the properti right and the transact in a countri where all carbon sequestr potenti is own by the nation and there are no transact the nation will natur bear all risk in a situat where a privat forest owner contract with a privat factori to provid an offset the term of the contract may spell out who bear the risk even in a contractu situat there may be room for the law to establish basic assumpt on risk for exampl the law may establish who bear the risk when the contract is silent on the issu this may be a matter of exist contract law howev some nation may eventu establish specif standard cover ghg mitig transact in countri that adopt regulatori provis concern offset the situat may be more complex those law may recogn oblig between sourc and govern sourc and sink and sink and govern a failur by the sink could affect all three oblig and the law may treat the outcom differ in each case for exampl a law might requir sourc to contract with sink for offset befor a sourc may oper and it might requir contract sink to take reason precaut to protect the forest to qualifi as sink if a lightn strike caus sink owner forest to burn doe a have to return offset payment to factori owner b doe factori owner b lose permiss to oper doe a owe the govern ani penalti for the loss of the sink or the increas emiss of carbon from the fire the unfccc secretariat 2002b has produc an option paper for the sbsta discuss how the parti might deal with

requir the oper of a forest activ to demonstr financi legal and technic viabil befor the claim or transfer carbon sequestr credit liabil clear liabil rule regard contract as discuss abov and tort and offenc as discuss in the next section of this paper will tend to deter some riski activ risk manag regul could requir oper to design project to minim risk group activ into portfolio could reduc the risk of total failur insur insur system could be set up either privat or through the govern the insur would collect premium from those invest in forest offset the insur would use some or all of the premium to pay for a reserv of unus offset if an insur investor experi a failur the reserv would cover the loss credit reserv the law could requir the govern a broker or one of the other particip in credit or offset trade to hold credit in reserv to cover possibl loss buffer the law could requir each forest claim remov credit to retain a percentag of the credit as a buffer the owner could tap the buffer to cover futur loss use similar reason the law could initi requir a sourc to obtain more than a 100 percent offset for it emiss if the offset partial fail the law would not penal the sourc unless the offset drop below 100 percent the law may want to draw distinct base on intent or culpabl one rule may state who bear the risk of act of natur while anoth state who bear the risk of loss from neglig or intent act the law may recogn degre of neglig or may apport respons where multipl caus contribut to the loss these kind of issu should be familiar to contract and regulatori lawyer the issu are analog to the one rais in other contractu and regulatori situat liabil and damag if the owner of a forest suffer damag to the valu of the forest owe to the action of anoth the law will often offer some way for the forest owner to recov the loss this may involv bring a suit befor the court seek damag the court may base the amount of the damag on the monetari loss to the owner if carbon sequestr becom a commod the law may automat includ loss of carbon sequestr in damag calcul in some countri the legislatur may wish to elimin ani possibl doubt by declar that owner may seek damag relat to carbon sequestr loss calcul damag can be complic in a forest injuri case becaus the lost valu of commod doe not reflect the total injuri there is also an injuri to the product capac of the forest for exampl let us say that a nation follow the exampl of the protocol and measur carbon sequestr in fiveyear period a landown afforest his or her land at the start of the first period becaus of the rate at which tree grow the new forest will sequest relat littl carbon dure the first five year it will perform better dure the next five year becaus the tree are older and larger depend on the tree and the site this improv trend could continu for sever more cycl now assum that someon set fire to the forest at the end of the first cycl the amount of sequest carbon lost is relat small howev the fire has reset the clock of ecolog success to zero in the next five year the forest will again sequest relat littl carbon besid destroy the small gain of the forest the fire has delay futur gain valu the injuri to product capac can be difficult it requir a good understand of the rate at which tree will grow on the site throughout their live if the forest is of a type common manag for wood product forest may have this inform for mani forest howev the inform may be unavail and even with this inform calcul the loss will be complic where fire or other injuri has kill onli some of the tree on the whole the current state of the art in forestri may not alway be capabl of assign accur valu to these kind of injuri the law can help by set out some guidanc if the land is in privat ownership and the marketplac accur captur the valu of the land for carbon sequestr loss of market valu to the land may be an adequ measur if the land is onli recent forest then the damag should includ the cost of restor of forest cover restor chang may also be appropri where the injur land is part of a protect area in situat where actual damag are difficult to determin the law can set standard measur of damag these could be detail formula base on area forest type age and other factor or they could be arbitrari relat high figur set to deter forest injuri as well as compens injur owner becaus there is a social interest in deterr of forest injuri some jurisdict allow forest owner to claim damag of two or three time the valu of lost wood the law could appli similar multipli to the valu of lost carbon sequestr anoth mean of increas deterr is to make destruct of carbon sequestr an offenc particular in countri where the averag person lack the capit to pursu a lawsuit or pay damag a crimin approach may be the most effect way to deter injuri of cours exist law concern crimin trespass or damag to govern or privat properti may be suffici to creat deterr howev it may be appropri to direct the court to consid loss of carbon sequestr valu when weigh the sever of the offenc if the nation expect carbon sequestr to remain a public good the law might empow the govern to sue to seek damag such damag might be base on the cost of restor altern the law could specifi some simpl formula for calcul damag base on the area of forest injur or the volum of wood injur or lost such a formula could simplifi proof of loss particular if there is no local market set a valu on sequest carbon one model for such a damag scheme is the natur resourc damag provis in the unit state law govern liabil for releas of

law or guidanc on impact assess can overcom these hurdl and ensur that analyst weigh climat impact when review forest project mani countri have plan requir that appli to public or privat forest manag cannot manag forest without shortterm oper plan or longterm manag plan typic the law requir that these plan protect the product of the forest resourc at a minimum plan make the owner awar of the cost

these typic focus on hazard or toxic pollut govern could requir the forest industri to prepar ghg emiss reduct plan for forest manag research legal mandat research general take one of two form one is a kind of subsidi where the govern commit itself to conduct research and make the result freeli avail the other is a form of regul where the govern order other to gather inform or conduct test and pass the inform on to the public or the govern to understand and improv the effect of lulucf project each forest countri will benefit from research on the behaviour of it own forest just as forest requir a fair amount of local specif inform to determin the optim manag for produc timber forest will need local specif inform for optim manag for carbon sequestr research may also improv the accuraci of local inventori method and aid in measur and certif of the amount of carbon sequest a larg industri landown might have the abil to conduct this sort of research but the govern itself may want to conduct the research for the benefit of small privat landown and for the better manag of public forest rather than conduct the research on small plot in dedic experiment forest some of the research on public land could be in the form of adapt manag in the cours of manag of public land for carbon sequestr the govern would care vari it action from stand to stand by monitor the result forest growth the govern would learn about how the land react to manag the result would lead to better manag decis in the long term if a countri doe host larg privat industrialscal carbon sequestr project it may want to requir project oper to conduct research for exampl it might requir that larg oper present the result of survey of soil carbon content or nontre biomass befor they could get their project
