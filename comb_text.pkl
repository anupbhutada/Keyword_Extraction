aS'Justin Bieber and Ashton Kutcher the worst buddy film ever\nWill Kutcher and Bieber make as woeful a double act as Robert Carlyle and Samuel L Jackson or Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy The script for What Would Kenny Do has had a terrific birth A buddy comedy about a 17yearold boy guided by a hologram of himself as an adult it made the prestigious Black List of unproduced screenplays three years ago before being touched up by 500 Days of Summers Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber Now Will Smiths production company is interested in finally taking it to the screen But dont get too excited Its been reported that the two stars of What Would Kenny Do look set to be Ashton Kutcher and Justin Bieber Again thats Ashton Kutcher  last seen playing Ashton Kutcher in a film about Ashton Kutcher being Ashton Kutcher And Justin Bieber  last seen being shot to death on an episode of CSI Together On screen At the same time Together Worse still depending on your point of view Ashton Kutcher will be playing a version of Justin Bieber or Justin Bieber will be playing a version of Ashton Kutcher Either way you should probably brace yourself for something genuinely nightmarish But if Kutcher and Bieber think that they can just swan in and become the most offensively terrible double act of all time theyve got another thing coming Movie history is littered with the corpses of hopelessly mismatched buddy films and Kutcher and Bieber will have to go over and above the call of duty if they even want to breathe the same air as some of the worst For example it barely seems feasible that Kutcher and Bieber could be as spectacularly woeful as Robert Carlyle and the kiltwearing version of Samuel L Jackson in The 51st State Prior to that film Carlyle was the fiery future of British acting and Jackson was the coolest man alive Afterwards Carlyle slunk off to America to make dodgy scifi TV shows and Jackson primarily became known for being the bloke out of Snakes on a Plane And theres little chance that What Would Kenny Do will be nearly as hopeless as 1997s Double Team the film that consciously decided to buddy JeanClaude Van Damme with greenhaired basketball weirdo Dennis Rodman and make them battle a nonspecific international conspiracy by jumping out of an aeroplane and getting chased around by tigers Or Burt Reynolds and nineyearold Norman D Golden II in Cop And A Half Or Sylvester Stallone and Estelle Getty in Stop or My Mom Will Shoot Or Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett in Hollywood Homicide And Ill be staggered if Ashton Kutcher and Justin Bieber could summon up even less chemistry than Pat Morita and Jay Leno managed in their godawful 1989 action comedy Collision Course But perhaps we shouldnt write Kutcher and Bieber off yet After all as both a former and prospective host of MTVs Punkd they obviously have an affinity with abject dreadfulness And if there are any two people on Earth capable of being as stingingly unwatchable as Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy were in 2002s Showtime its them Im sure they wont let me down '

aS'Now enters the mighty Chewbacca\nThis is it the moment everyones been waiting for Ever since The Clone Wars series began 2 12 years ago speculation has run rampant that at some point wed see wookiees and specifically the beloved Chewbacca before theyre ensnared by the Empire post Revenge of the Sith Good relation with the Wookies I have Yoda mentions to his fellow Jedi Council members in the aforementioned film leading us to speculate where this connection hails from After seeing The Clone Wars latest and last episode of Season Three Wookiee Hunt premiering tonight its safe to say we dont get to see this direct connection explored at this time but the ending definitely sets up for that relationship down the line Supervising Director Dave Filoni and Director of this twoepisode story arc has said that new character models created for use in the show are never prepared for onetime use due to the time and resources they require This recent interview quip hints at future episodes involving the big walking carpet which may indeed go into that relationship whose beginnings mayve been broached here at the end of Wookiee Hunt its in the final scene that we see Chewbacca standing on a landing pad with our contingent of heroes including wise Council Master Yoda Though theres no dialogue between them yet theres a pervasive sense that a new alliance has just been forged with the Wookiees whove protected and saved the Jedi Padawans surely this act will not be forgotten and may be the inroads to a special working interaction in Season 4 and beyond In my review of Padawan Lost I said much about the incredible environments of Felucia and Wasskah the lighting and animation implemented to bring its breathtaking beauty to life and the sheer terror the Trandoshan hunters instill as they carry out their cinematic homage to The Most Dangerous Game 1932 which Im happy to report carries on for this installment as well I also went into the great characterization of one of the Padawans Kalifa and noted how I was looking forward to also being able to become betteracquainted with the two others OMer and Jinx We do indeed get a good deal of characterization concerning them both but the real standout as it should be is in the animation quality and verisimilitude exhibited by Peter Mayhews Chewbacca It just goes to show the lengths that Filoni and crew are willing to go to in translating the zeal and energy from the liveaction films into a medium that will better connect the two trilogies into the cohesive 13 hr epic we know so well Most would never even question that an actor in a big furry suit has a particular grace and style thats inconic and instantlyrecognizable yet you know it when you see it The fact that The Clone Wars team brought Chewbacca actor Peter Mayhew into the studio for reference works so well youll be gasping at the sight of him in action and instantly recognize that he truly is the one and only actor for the role From his expressive eyes to his reallife 7 ft 3 in lumbering stride to the casual way he leans back into a relaxed pose its all Chewie And with Mayhews practiced Wookiee growl through the years at conventions for the first time its his voice helping to bring the zoo animalsound mixture into the familiar and resonate growl we all know and love Advertisement The action in this episode is indeed intense and engaging and visuallypays off what fans have long heard of yet never yet seen Wookiees engaging in battle against the slithery Trandoshan slavers that would ensnare them Having Ahsoka and the two remaining Padawans in the mix of the battle makes it that much more thrilling and I would be remiss if I didnt mention the superb blending of iconic John Williams Star Wars musical themes in all the right places never overused it is implemented by series musical composer Kevin Kiner in just the right dosage to really get the gooseflesh standing up in all the right moments In other words Chewies big return is all its been hyped up to be and if its not already more than enough that well be seeing the survivor Darth Maul back in action down the road one can now begin dreaming that a future Chewie appearance will be graced by his rescuer a brash young Corellian pirate who turned mainstream audiences onto the scifantasy epic in the first place with his cynical everyman pointofentry into that world as Han Solo As always there are never any guarantees of that but just my own speculation but however George Lucas Filoni and crew forge ahead with Season 4 we can rest assured its only going to be nothing short of continuing to be mindblowing Season 3 wraps up tonight with Padawan Lost followed by Wookie Hunt during a special 1hour finale on Cartoon Network beginning at 8 PM ETPT

going to beach parties while driving round the bay blasting Ace Of Base In the winter while the bay hibernated hed fiddle with electronic sounds on his home computer By the time Joe was 18 Metronomy was fully formed in his mind Almost immediately he moved away As a student in Brighton he put together a band to play his songs enlisting his cousin Oscar Cash and Gabriel Stebbing to play keyboards and bass Mount then moved to London where he made up for a youth without a scene I became so absorbed in London he says I was caring about what NME said who the new bands were getting jealous when others were doing better than us I was going out every night just because I could Metronomys second album Nights Out offered despondent reportage from that metropolitan underworld Or as Mount puts it now Eugh parties Nights Out was successful enough for Mount to spend the next year attending parties in places which had pop music in their bones Where Im from if youre into music you really struggle There are no venues no bands no scene I wanted to make music like that for the people I grew up with So where there wasnt a scene Joe started to imagine one He summoned up images of American west coast cool He loved the thought of workshy stoner bands sleeping in until 12 hitting the beach and stumbling across songbook classics like shells in the sand This area is very laidback there are kids whove got so much time they can spend hours in a recording studio and make this sunkissed seaside music he says I was trying to imagine what that would sound like Thats why the new album shares its

chat While he had been in the grip of his musical fantasies bandmate Gabriel left the band to concentrate on being frontman of Your Twenties It forced Joe to reconsider the concept of Metronomy as a spiky synth wonkpop party band and retool it as a fourpiece Squeaking doors and 99p toy synthesizers staples of Metronomys sound until now were replaced by more delicate percussion and warm lounge keyboards Although the album is selfproduced I imagined what a producer would say to me The first thing hed say would be Stop cluttering up your songs with weird little noises So that was that Metronomy transformed themselves from a newrave London threepiece to the Fleetwood Mac of the West Country Welcome to The English Riviera please drift slowly Wind in our hair and sun on our skin its easy to buy in to Joes American dream in the goldenbrown resort that English pessimism forgot Torbay however is still Torbay We walk down the wide coastal road lined by what looks like a Jersey Shore

finds a flyer boasting LADY GAGA IS IN TOTNES TONIGHT with a picture of a girl in a blonde wig and papiermache dress A quick Google search reveals she does Christina and Britney tributes too As for Mount himself he wouldnt know how to deploy the bombast that comes naturally to Californians His face spattered with brown freckles his manner is polite considered and encumbered by a modest Englishness His answers are always suffixed with an awkward  but I dont know and he describes the popularity of the XX and James Blake as the rise of groovy music  Its this clash of Super8 US fantasy with stark English reality that makes The English Riviera a triumph Its sparse arrangements commanding firstperson narrative and offkilter rhythms will lead to comparisons with LCD Soundsystem But while James Murphys barbed nihilism is a deadpan dissection of New York living Mounts rosetinted love letter to Torbay paints a picture of a home to which hed like to return I know its not very cool to be from the south is it he says But it would be so disrespectful to people who grew up in worse places to just moan about where you came from Nights Out was a bit cynical adds Oscar This ones supposed to be affectionate Its offering a sound to bands heres an idea you could try this Its not very cool to be from the south is it But its so disrespectful to people who grew up in worse places to just moan about where you come from Metronomy keyboards and sax man Oscar Cash Photograph Linda Nylind for the Guardian The record has none of the brashness of US yacht rock Even its most brazen

over a Roland keyboard and warbling something that sounds a bit like Poker Face Behind her two very enthusiastic male dancers do their best to make the whole thing look less like The Mighty Boosh After the third airing of Bad Romance we give up and head to the kebab shop to talk about our favourite Magic FM bands over a polystyrene box full of sweating lettuce These LA bands like the Beach Boys and the Eagles they had so much time says Mount doner meat dangling from his lip It was just Lets go chill out Smoke a doob Spend three months in the studio Smoke a doob Does he think its the same here I think it could be But all it ends up creating is drumnbass DJs tribute acts and singersongwriter shit Theres another guy from round here who got a record deal recently who does that James Morrison stylething Thats what it creates a kind of douchebaggery The next day Joe flies off to Paris to play a DJ set at 4am Once hed been blinded by stage lights the charms of a Torbay sunset were never going to be enough But he no longer fears the ennui that follows a smalltown upbringing nor that of middling indie fame He may not be the coolest man in London but Joe smiles the smile of a man who know hes already lodged himself into local history Ive already been getting emails from the English Riviera tourist board he grins Their Google alerts must be going crazy '

aS'Gadhafis gas stations pose dilemma for Europe\nFlames and smoke shoot up from the Libyanowned oil refinery on the eastern tip of Lake Geneva suggesting one of Moammar Gadhafis outposts in Europe is still in business As world powers tighten their military and financial grip around his regime some governments are hesitating to freeze all of the assets controlled by the North African countrys repressive ruler An Associated Press investigation has found that several European countries have accepted assurances from Libyas Tamoil petroleum company that none of its profits reach Tripoli In return Tamoil has been allowed to continue operating unchecked despite the fact its parent company is on a United Nations sanctions list Officials at Tamoils European headquarters didnt return requests for comment but representatives at four of the groups national subsidiaries said they were abiding by the sanctions No money from the gas stations flows directly or indirectly to persons or institutions subject to sanctions Catrin Bedi of Tamoils German subsidiary told AP All money was reinvested to expand the German operation she said Yet experts say European governments are being naive or simply selfserving in an attempt to protect European jobs and oil supplies Its a political decision It would be naive to think that Tamoil is independent said Zurichbased moneylaundering expert Michael Alkalay He said Western governments that readily did business with Libya in recent years now criticize Gadhafis regime but are doing little to clamp down on its assets the most visible of which is Tamoil whose logo fronts gas stations from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean Gary Hufbauer a former US Treasury deputy assistant secretary in the Carter administration said European governments  which like the US have frozen Libyan cash deposits in their banks  are essentially taking Tamoils word for it that the profits wont get back to Gadhafi If the Europeans are serious about imposing the freeze they shouldnt be allowing any money to be paid if its going to any part of the Libyan regime said Hufbauer now a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington World powers intentionally stopped short of naming Tamoil in their sanctions lists he said citing its importance to Europe The companys Swiss branch is registered in the southwestern town of CollombeyMuraz where it operates a 72000 barrelsperday refinery that supplies more than 300 gas stations throughout Switzerland Sister companies in Spain Germany the Netherlands and Italy operate 2500 more gas stations and there are two other refineries in Hamburg Germany and Cremona Italy The refineries combined capacity is 255000 barrels of crude oil a day or about 2 percent of the 14 million barrels that power Europe daily Libya was producing 158 million barrels a day of crude oil in January according to International Energy Agency figures All are part of a Dutchbased holding company Oilinvest Netherlands BV whose sales ran to some 10 billion in 2009 Oilinvest in turn is owned by the Libyan Investment Authority the countrys sovereign wealth fund estimated to be worth 65 billion Last month the LIA was placed under international sanctions on the grounds that it is controlled by Gadhafi or persons close to him Tamoils links to the regime however arent enough for Switzerland to shut it down according to the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs or SECO Tamoil has pledged in writing to SECO to fully respect the sanctions imposed by the Swiss Federal Council in particular not to make any payments or transfer other assets in whichever form to natural or legal persons who are subject to sanctions spokeswoman Antje Baertschi told AP She acknowledged that Switzerland isnt checking whether Tamoil is living up to its pledge nor could she say when Tamoil made its last payment to Libya Its not possible to monitor all transactions she said A spokesman for Germanys Economy Ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity said Berlin was satisfied Tamoil would comply with international sanctions after receiving written assurances Monitoring compliance was a matter for the prosecutors he said But in a sign that some Tamoil entities are prepared to go further to protect their operations the companys German spokeswoman Bedi said an external auditor would be given access to its books Meanwhile Italys Finance Ministry said in a statement last week that no freezing measure has been adopted toward Tamoil Italia Spa which it said was collaborating with the authorities to ensure the adopted international sanctions are respected fully regarding the situation in Libya Charles Huyskens a spokesman for Tamoils branch in the Netherlands told AP the company had struck a deal with the Dutch government The operation here is business as usual but the guarantee is that they will not transfer money abroad or to any shareholder or whatever he said Finance Ministry spokesman Niels Redeker disputed this saying the government was still in talks with Tamoil to prevent cash reserves from reaching entities on the banned list But these are talks and have not led to any agreement Dutch opposition lawmaker Harry van Bommel said Tamoils many shell companies in tax havens  from Monaco to Curacao in the Caribbean  make it impossible to guard against Gadhafis allies funneling money out of the company All assets of Tamoil should be frozen period he said Were talking about UN resolutions were talking about Gadhafi who is willing to kill his own people Would he not ask a company under his control to transfer assets US sanctions apply to anything owned or controlled by the government of Libya which would include Tamoil if it did business with or processed payments through the US said a senior US Treasury Department official speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter After Libya agreed to scrap its secret nuclear weapons program and compensate victims of terrorist attacks the US in 2006 rescinded its designation as a state sponsor of terrorism And with the country emerging from international isolation western firms rushed to sign oil exploration deals Libyas more than 46 billion barrels of oil reserves are the largest in Africa and all but five percent of its exports come from oil Flush with petrodollars Libya invested heavily in foreign assets from Spanish banks to Italian football clubs and a growing network of petroleum companies in the long chain stretching from supplier to consumer EU documents show that the 27nation bloc has used financial sanctions against Iran Iraq Myanmar North Korea Yugoslavia Zimbabwe as well as Libya In recent years there have been increasing calls for targeted financial sanctions that aim to freeze a person or a companys profits rather than shut it down and cause broader economic distress Enrico Carisch a USbased Swiss field investigator who has worked for the UN enforcing sanctions against Somalia Liberia Congo and Sudan said Tamoils profits should be frozen rather than simply shut down Every government has to conduct due diligence to make sure they are not inadvertently contributing to the problem he said The enemy is not Libyan workers the enemy is not Libyan companies The enemy is those who derive benefits from the Libyan oil and use them against the Libyan people One argument for keeping Tamoil afloat is that any future government in Libya would be entitled to reclaim ownership over the company on behalf of ordinary Libyans An attempt by Los Angelesbased private investment firm Colony Capital LLC in 2007 to buy a 65 percent stake in Tamoil and Oilinvest from the Libyan government valued the entire company at over 8 billion The deal never came off Sven Behrendt a Genevabased expert on sovereign wealth funds said Tamoil may only be the most visible tip of the Libyan Investment Authoritys assets He recently ranked the LIA among the least transparent of some two dozen sovereign wealth funds making it difficult for governments to fully know what it owns or controls The most immediate threat to the companys operations may be its rivals Royal Dutch Shell has halted a supply agreement with Tamoil in the Netherlands citing the international sanctions The parties are due in court next week Meanwhile a monthlong maintenance period at the Swiss refinery has been brought forward to April due to uneconomical margins a spokesman there said  '

aS'WRAPUP 3Fitch says Portugal needs bailout SP cuts Ireland\n Portugal shortterm borrowing costs hit 58 percent  SP cuts Irish rating Fitch may follow suit  Economists see even lower Irish growth  Bailout remains on for Portugal Spain seen sheltered Updates with Fitch downgrade of Portugal By Andrei Khalip and Carmel Crimmins LISBONDUBLIN April 1 Reuters  Credit rating agency Fitch downgraded Portugal on Friday saying the debtladen country needed a bailout while rival agency SP cut Irelands rating after bank stress tests revealed another black hole Despite a successful Portuguese debt sale on Friday Fitch slashed its rating to the lowest investment grade rank of BBB The severity of the downgrade by three notches mainly reflects Fitchs concern that timely external support is much less likely in the near term following yesterdays announcement of general elections to take place on 5 June said Douglas Renwick Director in Fitchs Sovereign Ratings Group The agency views external support as necessary to bolster the credibility of Portugals fiscal consolidation and economic reform effort as well as secure its financing position Renwick said in a statement IDnN01238604 Earlier Standard  Poors became the last of the three major rating agencies to strip Ireland of its A rating However the one notch cut and stable outlook was less severe than feared and it gave the thumbs up to stress tests which on Thursday showed its four troubled banks needed a further 24 billion euros to be properly capitalised IDnLDE72T20R  Stories on Portugals debt crisis IDnLDE68T0MG Euro zone struggles with debt rreuterscomhyb65p Interactive timeline on crisis linkreuterscomcan23r  Portugal sold 1645 billion euros of shortdated bonds on Friday but had to offer an interest rate of 579 percent lower than other current market rates but 25 percentage points more than it paid at similar auctions last year IDnLDE7300QU Lisbon is now having to pay a higher interest rate to borrow money for the next 15 months than Spain is paying to raise funds for 10 years  a clear indication of how much risk investors now attach to Portugal Portugals 10year bond yields went on rising despite the smooth auction hitting 877 percent up more than a percentage point in the past week Irelands reached 101 percent nearly 65 percentage points higher than benchmark German Bunds Richard McGuire a debt strategist at Rabobank said that while Fridays auction showed Lisbon could still tap the markets if needed the trend was bleak Portugal is fundamentally insolvent  ie it is clearly in a situation where debt will have to be issued to cover servicing costs thereby resulting in a snowballing of liabilities he said SP whose rubbishing of a previous final bill for Irelands banking sector sent the countrys debt crisis into overdrive last year said the assumptions underlying the latest round of tests of bank resilience were robust But rival agency Fitch took the shine off SPs modest downgrade when it warned it could cut its BBB rating on the back of weaker growth and a jump in the bank bailout costs A Reuters poll of economists gave a consensus forecast of just 05 percent growth in Ireland this year well below the official forecast of 17 percent and weaker than the 09 percent pencilled in by the European Commission and IMF GREEK MEMORIES Underscoring the tenuous nature of Portugals finances the statistics agency had to restate the 2010 budget deficit on Thursday increasing the shortfall to 86 percent of gross domestic product from 73 percent IDnLDE72U17E The adjustment was down to methodology and will not affect 2011 figures but still undermines broader confidence reviving memories of the Greek deficit revision of 2009 that lit the fuse of the euro zone debt crisis Financial markets are convinced Lisbon will have to ask the European Union and International Monetary Fund for a bailout However caretaker Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates who resigned last week after parliament rejected his latest spending cuts has made it a point of honour not to accept EUIMF help Portugals president dissolved parliament on Thursday and set June 5 as the date for the next polls meaning the country is effectively in limbo for two more months While Portugal can probably go on funding itself for the next eight weeks  it has to refinance 43 billion euros 61 billion of debt in April and 49 billion in June  the cost of doing so is likely to go on being punitively high IRISH BANK BILL The debt crisis in the euro zone has already consumed Greece and Ireland and shows few signs of relenting The 24 billion euros extra bank bill for Ireland which received an 85 billion euro package of aid from the EU and IMF in November was in line with market expectations and coupled with the European Central Banks decision to suspend collateral requirements for loans from Ireland gave the Irish banking sector a lift on Friday IDnLDE7300KK IDnLDE72U1QQ The European Commission said it believed the stress tests had been extremely rigorous and that there should now be no more surprises lurking for the financial markets But Ireland still has accumulated bank liabilities of nearly 45 percent of GDP and will have total debts of well over 100 percent of GDP if forecasts from the stress tests are right If the European Central Bank raises interest rates next week as expected the impact on growth will be even greater in both Ireland and Portugal driving up debttoGDP ratios without the debt increasing Additional reporting by Sergio Goncalves and Shrikesh Laxmidas in Lisbon and

aS'Google founder hopes to prove hes ready to lead\nLarry Page takes over as CEO Mon replacing Eric Schmidt a veteran Silicon Valley executive AP SAN FRANCISCO  Google cofounder Larry Page is known for his vision passion and intelligence Yet there is a fair amount of concern that Pages other known traits  his aloofness rebellious streak and affinity for pursuing wacky ideas  might lead the company astray Page takes over as CEO on Monday as fastrising rivals and tougher regulators threaten Googles growth Investors used to Google Incs consistency in exceeding financial targets worry that new leadership will bring more emphasis on longterm projects that take years to pay off And many people still arent sure he has enough management skills to steer the Internets most powerful company Page already has learned that smarts alone wont make him a great leader Although Page impressed Googles early investors with his ingenuity they still insisted that he step down in 2001 as Googles first CEO He turned over the job to Eric Schmidt a veteran executive who began working in Silicon Valley in the early 1980s while Page was still in grammar school Gmail Motion Googles revolutionary new technology Pages admirers say that at 38 he is more mature and less apt to be chronically late to meetings or tune out of conversations that dont stimulate his intellect  habits that he fell into during his first stint as CEO There are parts of being CEO that dont fit Larrys personality said Craig Silverstein the first employee that Page and Googles other founder Sergey Brin hired when they started the company in 1998 You wear a lot of different hats when youre CEO Some of them are very interesting to Larry and some of them presumably are less interesting True to his taciturn form Page hasnt said much publicly since Google made its stunning announcement in January that he will replace Schmidt as CEO Google said Page wasnt available for an interview Page though has left little doubt about his top priority to dissolve the bureaucracy and complacency that accompanied the companys rapid transformation into a 21stcentury empire Google is expected to end the year with more than 30000 employees and 35 billion in annual revenue In Pages mind the 13yearold company needs to return to thinking and acting like a feisty startup Rising Internet stars such as Facebook Twitter and Groupon all less than 8 years old are developing products that could challenge Google and make its dominance of Internet search less lucrative Page has drawn comparisons to two hightech geniuses who are even more accomplished Microsoft Corp cofounder Bill Gates and Apple Inc cofounder Steve Jobs Like those two pioneers in personal technology Page invented and cultivated a product that changed the world But Page has yet to match them in this respect as CEOs Gates and Jobs brought out the best in the companies that they created delighting stockholders as their investments soared Page doesnt fit the CEO mold even by the standards of Silicon Valleys freewheeling culture He dropped out of graduate school at Stanford to start Google and doesnt have a business degree Science and technology though seems to be in his DNA even though he grew up in Michigan where automobiles rule His late father Carl was a computer scientist and pioneer in artificial intelligence and his mother taught computer programming Page began working on personal computers when he was just 6 years old in 1979 when home computers were a rarity The geeky impulses carried into his adulthood leading him to once build an inkjet printer out of Legos Page relishes challenging the status quo and encourages his employees to do so too Those who know Page suspect he picked up the antiestablishment mindset as a boy who attended Montessori schools which discourage structured curricula and encourage independent activities Page has wanted to control his own destiny  and legacy  since reading a biography of the inventor Nikola Tesla before he was even in high school Tesla wasnt rewarded or widely recognized for his breakthroughs in Xray wireless communications and electricity Page didnt want that to happen to him as an entrepreneur For that reason Page embraced the chance to be Googles CEO when the company started in a rented garage not far from the companys current headquarters in Mountain View Calif It also helps explain why he and Brin created a separate class of stock with greater voting power so they and Schmidt could remain in charge after the company went public in 2004 Pages stake in Google has made him one of the worlds wealthiest people with an estimated fortune of 20 billion Although the contours of his personality and background are known quantities Page remains an enigmatic figure on Wall Street To some he remains best known for uncompromising idealism reflected in his embrace of his companys Dont Be Evil motto and his pledge to never cater to investors desire for everrising quarterly earnings at the expense of longterm investments Page already raised concerns by pushing Google into renewable energy and robotic cars Those who know him say he has discussed even more farflung projects behind closed doors Sometimes his ideas are just way out there and youre kind of like Wow that came out of left field said Ethan Anderson a former Google product manager who now runs Redbeacon a startup that operates a search engine for finding neighborhood businesses Uncertainty about whether Page will be as interested as Schmidt in appeasing Wall Street has contributed to a 6 percent drop in Googles stock price since the CEO change was announced Jan 20 The technologydriven Nasdaq index has added 3 percent during that time BGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis doesnt believe its a coincidence that Google revealed it would hire more than 6200 employees this year  a 25 percent boost and the most in its history  less than a week after it announced Pages comeback as CEO Dont be surprised if Googles spending goes up even it means its earnings per share might go down Gillis said Pages supporters believe Googles current market value of about 190 billion will climb even higher under his leadership That would mirror what happened after Jobs finally got his chance to run Apple in 1997 after a decade in exile Since then Apple has brought out the iconic iPod iPhone and iPad devices and created more than 300 billion in shareholder wealth But the returns of company founders havent always been triumphant Consider Yahoo Inc cofounder Jerry Yangs second stint as CEO from June 2007 to January 2009 Yahoos stock fell 56 percent during that period larger than the 41 percent drop for Nasdaq Unlike the rest of the Nasdaq Yahoo shares arent close to rebounding to their June 2007 levels Hoping to smooth the transition to a new CEO Google is keeping Schmidt 55 in a prominent role as executive chairman and chief liaison with lawmakers and regulators around the world Thats an important job as Google faces growing scrutiny over its ambitions to use its dominance in search to enter new markets Brin 37 intends to focus on longterm projects leaving Page to manage Googles daily operations I am quite convinced that this change will result in faster decisionmaking better success for the business and ultimately greater value for the shareholders Schmidt told The Associated Press after Google announced its shakeup in January In the past the three made key decisions by committee though Schmidt was the one responsible as CEO Schmidt guided Google through an uninterrupted stretch of prosperity that has topped the performances of other technology trailblazers including Apple and Microsoft at similar stages of their corporate lives Page is better prepared to be CEO after a decade as Schmidts apprentice said Douglas Merrill who worked with both executives before leaving Google in 2008 as vice president of engineering Larry has grown over time Merrill said He has learned how to make projects work He has learned how to make sure things happen on time and in a predictable fashion Larry is a sort of a learning machine '

aS'Ireland wants to hit bank creditors ECB says no\nDUBLIN AP  Ireland still wants to force foreign bondholders to bear losses in debtcrippled banks but is being blocked by the European Central Bank which has the lenders on life support Finance Minister Michael Noonan said Friday Irelands bankbailout bill officially surged Thursday by 24 billion euros to 705 billion euros100 billion as part of a new round of ECBordered stress tests Ireland then unveiled plans to slash its largely nationalized banking sector down to just two Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks Ratings agency Standard  Poors the next day said the tests assumptions were robust that the worst was over and the economy is now set to recover gradually Although it downgraded Irelands credit rating by one notch citing increased risks for bondholders under new EU rules to come into effect in 2013 it expects the country to recover faster than Greece or Portugal  Europes other two worst debt offenders It added it didnt expect any more downgrades soon though SP rival Fitch warned soon after that it may cut its own BBB rating on Ireland soon as it assesses the stress tests and other developments since its last downgrade in December In stock markets traders reacted to the stress tests by chasing higher the shares of the two bank survivors while shares of Irelands only other publicly listed bank Irish Life  Permanent plunged to a record low on news it will be broken up But as experts digested the test results the issue of how far to push losses on the banks bondholders remained the focus Noonan said Ireland intends to force at least 5 billion euros7 billion in losses on the most junior class of bank bondholders as part of its surging bailout bill That represents a small concession by the ECB which had until this week opposed such a move But Noonan said hopes of forcing billions more in losses on senior bondholders  chiefly British German and American banks  were again vetoed by a majority of ECB governors during negotiations that ran right up to Thursdays announcements Noonan said Ireland would not act unilaterally against the orders of the ECB which along with the European Commission has been against forcing losses on bondholders since Irelands banking crisis erupted in 2008 European financial chiefs made protection of senior bondholders a condition of its November bailout agreement with Irelands previous government which was ousted from office three weeks ago amid voter fury over the terms of the deal Noonan expressed frustration with Europes plans to introduce burdensharing  forcing the creditors of failing banks to cover some debtrestructuring costs  under new rules after 2013 too late for Ireland He contrasted that with US policies that hit bondholders early in its own banking crisis The American way of doing things is to have burden sharing and to make creditors share in the pain The European way is different Noonan said Noonan said a minority of governors at the Frankfurtbased ECB notably Germanys Axel Weber agree with the Irish and American position and he still hoped it would prevail in the medium term But he said Ireland had to give up its hopes of greater burdensharing for now because the ECB is the key source of shortterm funds for all of Irelands banks none of which is able to borrow on open markets The bank in Frankfurt is supplying almost 200 billion euros280 billion of liquidity to the Irish banking system We said we wanted burdensharing but we would not do it unilaterally We would only do it with the agreement of Frankfurt and we didnt get the agreement Noonan told Irish state broadcasters RTE He said if Ireland burned any bondholders against ECB instructions it would risk a loan cutoff and financial chaos He said instead Ireland received the best we could hope for when the ECB pledged Thursday night to keep loaning Irelands banks money regardless of whether their credit ratings are slashed further Did we risk the liquidity flow of 200 billion euros being cut off particularly when we expect a downgrade of Irish bank paper he said The ECB has already permitted Ireland to impose heavy haircuts on the junior bondholders at Irelands most disastrously managed bank Anglo Irish It was the first to be nationalized in 2009 has cost the state more than 25 billion euros35 billion and is being dismantled In October Anglo offered its creditors holding 35 billion euros in subordinated bonds a deal that they could be repaid a fraction of their investment between 5 percent and 20 percent  or refuse the offer and forfeit even more The Central Bank of Ireland last month said Irelands six banks still have nearly 7 billion euros in outstanding subordinated bonds which is debt that gets repaid in the event of bankruptcy only after senior bondholders get their money back Those bondholders are next in line for brutal haircuts according to Noonan But ECB policy means Ireland cannot impose cuts on 164 billion euros in senior bonds that are unsecured and outside the scope of Irelands bank insurance Nor can the Irish prune any of the 19 billion euros in secured but unguaranteed bank bonds Secured bonds are debt backed by collateral that can be handed over in case the debt goes unpaid Noonan said Ireland reserves the right to push the ECB for approval to discount all remaining bonds at Anglo and Irish Nationwide should any major bondholders there seek to cash in their positions early Like Anglo Irish Nationwide has already been fully nationalized forced to transfer its deposit base to surviving banks and is being

aS'Nasdaq ICE bid to snatch NYSE from Germans\nGreifeld promised shareholders far bigger cost savings than in the German deal but he did not say how severe the job losses would be He said Nasdaq would keep the NYSE floor  the icon of capitalism that was created in 1792 by brokers and merchants who met under a buttonwood tree in lower Manhattan  Upstart trading venues like BATS have eaten deep into the market share of these traditional venues forcing them in the last decade to upgrade and embrace electronic trading  and to look to mergers to survive Nasdaq the smallest of the four exchanges in play needed to do something to stay relevant in the years ahead some said If it and ICE succeed the worlds largest bourse operators would be headquartered in the United States Brazil and Asia  leaving Europe with a bruised Deutsche Boerse Nasdaq had a real risk of being marginalized said David Weild founder of Capital Markets Advisory Partners and former vice chairman at Nasdaq in the corporate client division Under the proposal Atlantabased ICE would purchase NYSEs Londonbased Liffe platform seen as a profitable gem while Nasdaq would acquire its stock exchanges in New York Paris Amsterdam Brussels and Lisbon its US options venues and its technology suite Some details of how a deal would work have not yet been worked out The management and the board of directors have not yet been determined Greifeld said adding he hadnt spoken to Niederauer or other NYSE executives But a group of banks led by Bank of America and Wells Fargo is prepared to arrange 38 billion of financing for the cash portion of the deal Nasdaq and ICE said From a purely nationalist point of view as an American a lot of people are going to say yeah yeah yeah thats great said Kenneth Polcari managing director at ICAP Corporates a NYSE floor broker But from a business point of view  from a true global perspective the Deutsche Boerse is probably the better option NYSE shares closed up 126 percent at 3960 while Deutsche Boerse closed down 14 percent in Frankfurt Nasdaq shares rose strongly through Friday to close at 2823 up 92 percent while ICE shares slipped 31 percent to 11975 BIDDING WAR Borse Dubai Nasdaqs largest shareholder and Swedens Investor AB the secondlargest said they backed the bid Deutsche Boerse said it continues to strongly believe that the envisaged merger of Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext is the best possible combination for both shareholder groups and the stakeholders of the companies NYSE Euronext said its board would carefully review the new offer and urged shareholders not to take any action pending its review A source said there was some shock that the cash portion of the counterbid was so small If I were at New York and Deutsche Boerse Id be thinking we dont have to match the price we just have to build up the cash component a bit said Thomas Caldwell CEO of Caldwell Securities Ltd a NYSE shareholder There is a steep 250 million euro 356 million termination fee attached to Deutsche Boerses friendly deal Moodys Investors Service said Nasdaqs announcement makes the agency more likely to cut the companys debt ratings to junk over the medium term while Standard  Poors said that it might cut the exchanges ratings to junk in the near term Two junk ratings could create a headache for the combined exchange because NYSE bondholders would have the right to force the company to buy back their 21 billion of debt Nasdaq could be forced to raise even more money In Liffe Sprecher would get an interestrate business that eluded him when ICEs bid for the Chicago Board of Trade failed four years ago and a successful deal could put pressure on chief rival CME Group Inc ICEs market cap is 92 billion about in line with NYSE Euronext For Nasdaq with a 45 billion market cap the deal would expand its core albeit lowmargin stocktrading business and could raise questions for shareholders well aware that the other exchange deals are driven largely by a need to diversify into more profitable derivatives trading EGOS AND OFFERS Nasdaq was created in 1971 as the worlds first electronic stock market by members of National Association of Securities Dealers frustrated by the Big Boards slowness to embrace new technology and seeking to pressure trading costs The vast majority of North American and European stock trading is now highspeed and allelectronic with Nasdaq and NYSE boasting some of the worlds best technology When Deutsche Boerse bid for NYSE CEO Reto Francioni acknowledged we have a bumpy road ahead of us Some observers say his career hinges on winning NYSE Intensifying the merger race regulators want to run much of the private swaps market though transparent venues in the wake of the financial crisis an opportunity for exchanges Under the counterbid NYSE shareholders would receive 1424 in cash plus 04069 of a share of Nasdaq stock The Deutsche Boerse proposal would exchange each NYSE Euronext share for 047 share of the combined companys stock Nasdaq and ICE said that within 12 to 18 months the combined franchise would provide doubledigit accretion to shareholders and save 740 million in annual operating costs The Deutsche Boerse deal sees 400 million in cost savings and that immediately add to adjusted earnings Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Evercore Partners are advising Nasdaq while Lazard Broadhaven

aS'The Week Ahead Buy Stocks Not The Market\nThe relentless nature of the rally from the March 16 lows has many market veterans scratching their heads The market is clearly overdue for the setback I was looking for last week Attempts by fund managers to goose their quarterly numbers likely played a role in the rally into the end of the month while the very good jobs numbers boosted stocks even higher on Friday One of the more surprising developments last week was the surge in smallcap stocks as the Russell 2000 moved above the February highs on Thursday This is very positive if the SP 500 and Nasdaq Composite can also surpass their February peaks as the Dow Industrials did on Friday The chart of the iShares Russell 2000 IWM shows the completion of the trading range lines a and b with upside targets at 8550 and then 87 Click to Enlarge The week ahead will be a quiet one in terms of economic reports with the ISM NonManufacturing Index on Tuesday that gives us a reading on the health of the economy followed by jobless claims Thursday The EIAs latest petroleuminventory report will be released Wednesday but more important for crude oil will be any new developments in Libya If Gaddafi were to step down it would dampen the rally in crude oil prices WHAT TO WATCH SP 500 The monthly chart of the Spyder Trust SPY shows that the next major resistance stands at 141 to 145 The lower monthly close for SPY has caused its momentum which had been rising since the end of September to flatten out Therefore a higher close in April is needed to keep the momentum from turning lower as it did in May 2010 The NYSE advancedecline line has surpassed its February highs which is positive for stocks in general There is initial support for SPY at 13150 and then at 13040 The 12830 level should hold on a deeper pullback Dow Industrials The Diamonds Trust DIA surpassed the February highs Friday at 12364 and has next resistance at 12480 and then 12850 to 129 Strong action last week leaves first support at 12250 to 12160 with much stronger levels in the 12050 area Sector Focus It was a tough quarter for stock pickers unless you were in the energy sector As I noted in Fridays article only the Energy Select Spyder XLE and the Industrial Select Spyder XLI were able to outperform the SP 500 in the first quarter This is quite unusual as more often there are three or four sectors that outperform the SP 500 Typically stocks are not as strong in the second quarter leading to the wellworn phrase sell in May and go away More Sector Focus '

aS'Proposed tax break to keep Twitter in city leads to classic San Francisco fracas\nSAN FRANCISCO  In the shadow of San Franciscos stately City Hall sidewalks abound with transients drugs and crime Into this neighbourhood one of the worlds hottest social media companies has promised to stride offering urban rebirth in exchange for a tax break Taxe incentives to bring businesses to blighted streets are not unusual But this is San Francisco And Twitter The mayor supports the plan but progressive politicians  and now the citys largest public employee union  call the proposal a poorly crafted giveaway to the rich The conflict comes at a time when the citys high tech economy teems with energy not seen since before the first Internet bubble burst more than a decade ago At issue is the citys payroll tax San Francisco is the only city in California to levy its business tax based on how much companies pay workers rather than how much money they take in Since Twitter emerged as a side project of a San Francisco podcasting company in 2006 the business has grown from a handful of employees to a few hundred With investors pouring money into Twitter the company expects to grow to more than 3000 To do that Twitter needs a lot more space One option would be to flee to a sprawling suburban campus in Silicon Valley where adding more employees would not mean adding to the tax bill But earlier this month recently appointed Mayor Ed Lee announced what seemed like a winning solution for everyone Twitter had signed a letter of intent to sign a sixyear lease on several hundred thousand square feet of office space in a historic building in the struggling MidMarket neighbourhood The only condition The city must agree to exempt Twitter from paying any new payroll taxes on any additional hires For a company that expects to add thousands of new of employees in the next few years the savings would add up quickly This is the moment we have been waiting for Lee said of the proposed deal The transformative nature of an anchor tenant like Twitter will revitalize this community Yet in San Francisco where an overall economy largely untouched by the recession has kept real estate prices among the highest in the country some lowincome residents worry that revitalization will just lead to higher rents And city employees facing layoffs and contract concessions thanks to a massive budget shortfall resent what they see as a giveaway to venture capitalists and a bailout for landlords Who are the Twitter investors Supervisor John Avalos told The San Francisco Examiner Probably some of the wealthiest people in this country And we are giving them more wealth Last Tuesday members of a neighbourhood group protested outside Twitters current headquarters about a mile from the proposed new offices They accused Twitter of not living up to its pledge to be a good neighbour They complained neither the city nor the company have considered the lowincome residents who would be adversely impacted by rising rents spurred by the prosperity Twitter could bring The residents are feeling that if theyre not going to benefit from this revitalization that the city is pushing for it really doesnt make sense for these companies to stay in San Francisco said Angelica Cabande director of South of Market Community Action Network Twitter declined to comment on the taxbreak fracas As a result of the controversy a lawmaker on the Board of Supervisors progressive wing Ross Mirkarimi has proposed an alternative measure he says will fix an underlying legal flaw that has led to anxiety among hot tech companies looking to grow San Franciscos payroll tax is unusual enough but one provision makes it even more unique The city in 2004 added language to the tax code to make clear that tax collectors considered stock options a part of employees compensation and hence taxable as part of the payroll For tech startups stock options are one of the most common ways to hold onto employees especially when a lack of funds doesnt allow them to offer competitive salaries When lucky companies reach a point where they can make their initial public offering of stock those options can turn into a major windfall for workers But for companies in San Francisco that windfall sticks employers with a huge tax increase right at the time theyve issued the stock in an effort to expand Mirkarimis proposal would place a twoyear moratorium on taxing any companys stock options to ease the fears not just of Twitter but other San Franciscobased startups like social gaming leader Zynga and consumer review website Yelp You dont want to write law in a way that only helps one company or one neighbourhood in one part of the city Mirkarimi said The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote Tuesday on the Twitter package and Mirkarimi predicts it will pass even without his vote If that happens Service Employees International Union Local 1021 the public employees union may seek a ballot measure that could delay the deal until voters weigh in City economic officials paint any failure of the deal not as a loss to Twitter but as a loss for the neighbourhood where more than half of the available commercial real estate sits vacant While Twitter is the big fish the city is seeking to catch any businesses within the geographic zone defined by the legislation would get a similar tax break The benefit we want which is jobs in this area is not happening without some incentive said Jennifer Matz director of the citys Office of Economic and Workforce Development Without such incentives she said the neighbourhood has not seen improvement for a generation It resisted the last dotcom boom '

aS'Larry Page set to take over as Google CEO starting Monday\nWhen Google GOOG cofounder Larry Page reclaims the role of CEO on Monday it will be business as usual at the Googleplex No formal ceremonies are planned There will be no speeches The absence of pomp underscores Pages intense focus on the job ahead  spurring Google to innovate faster as it battles Facebook and other competitors to react more like a nimble startup even as it zooms past 25000 employees As he takes the reins Pages aim appears to be to hone Googles sense of discipline to keep the companys management structure as flat as possible despite its growth and particularly to urge Googlers to continue to think big But there are also questions about whether Pages personality including his detachment and his past unwillingness to be the public face of Google will well serve a company facing a host of regulatory challenges To a large extent the culture of Google is what Larry wants it to be said Craig Silverstein who joined Page and cofounder Sergey Brin as the startups first employee in 1998 Google announced in January that Page Googles CEO from its incorporation in 1998 until Eric Schmidts arrival in 2001 would again become CEO this month Since then Page has made some subtle but interesting changes to how the company operates He has told Googlers to change how they run meetings to make them more focused and productive and he has directed executives to meet in public areas of the Googleplex so they will be more accessible to hearing ideas from rankandfile Googlers people familiar with the changes say Face of the company Schmidt and Brin have been more in the public spotlight in the past decade than the 38yearold son of a computer science professor from Michigan But Page has remained a driving force within Google since 2001 insisting on reviewing every hire people familiar with the company say and continuing to push hyperambitious projects like the companys effort to scan every book ever published into a vast digital library Its certainly true that Eric is the public face but inside Google the founders are still very much the face of the company said Silverstein who spoke just after the Jan 20 announcement of Pages new role Google declined to make Page available for an interview Paul Buchheit the former Googler who coined the phrase Dont Be Evil said Pages return sends a signal to Silicon Valley that innovation and taking risks for big ideas still matter at Google This notion that something being impossible doesnt really bother you thats really central to a lot of Googles big projects said Buchheit who created Gmail before leaving the company in 2006 Its taking on things that might be possible or might be impossible but if they are possible it would have a really big impact on the world Page has a foresight that few people have Silverstein added Page was a driving force for the massive computing power Google needed to create long before many at Google saw the need for products like Google Instant  the feature the search giant introduced last year and that Yahoo YHOO recently imitated that begins to offer search results as soon as users type a letter into the query box Hell have an idea that seems really crazy Silverstein said and there will be all this pushback and hell have none of it Outsidethebox CEO No one expects Page to be a standardissue CEO Those like Silverstein who know Page well say that while he isnt shy neither is he an extroverted hail fellow well met But he has also been described as brusque with people whose ideas he doesnt value and he has often shunned press attention Some Google watchers say Pages famous reticence and aversion to publicity may not serve him well as CEO Brilliant engineers like Page are really good at things they can measure They have a high IQ but often a low EQ or emotional quotient Ken Auletta who spent extensive time inside the Googleplex reporting his book Googled The End of the World as We Know It said in an email In addition Page faces a full and complex plate of legal and regulatory issues when he takes on his new job Just this week the Federal Trade Commission forced Google into a 20year commitment to accept outside supervision on privacy and archrival Microsoft filed an antitrust complaint against Google in Europe Larry is not as talented at things he cant measure like why governments and citizens might fear Googles dominance or issues like privacy and copyright Page certainly is more aware of government and other outside concerns But they make him impatient Which is dangerous when youre wrestling with an 800pound government gorilla Doubts cloud future Veteran tech analyst Rob Enderle who praised the reshuffling in January said he has become concerned since then that Page will not step up to the full requirements of the job which include being the human face of Google Yardsticks like profit and revenue suggest Google has never been more successful and its Android smartphone software gives the company a powerful foothold in the emerging mobile Web But Google stock is down nearly 6 percent since the Jan 20 announcement that Page would replace Schmidt as CEO a period in which the Nasdaq is up 3 percent Buchheit always believed Pages return as CEO was inevitable and that Pages determination to swing for the fences is critical to Googles identity It was just a question of when it was going to happen Buchheit said of Pages return He was originally the CEO and the only reason that changed was because the VCs required it to change He has a lot of pretty strong opinions about how this thing should be run and hes stayed very involved in the company '

aS'US Cancer Rates Continue to Fall\nReport suggests that better screening diagnosis and treatments are paying off THURSDAY March 31 HealthDay News  The rate of new cancers in the United States has dropped by almost 1 percent a year and the rate of death from cancer has fallen 16 percent a year a new report shows These declines seen between 2003 and 2007 continue a trend that began in the 1990s the researchers added Importantly this is the first time a drop in the rate of deaths from lung cancer among women has been seen coming a decade after lung cancer death rates started declining in men they noted The drop in lung cancer rates among women is due to women quitting smoking said report coauthor Lynn Ries a health statistician at the US National Cancer Institute Women started smoking a lot later than men so the peak in the mortality rate occurred a lot later she added The report is the work of researchers at the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries the US National Cancer Institute the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Cancer Society It is published in the March 31 online edition of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute  Although cancer rates are declining in adults there has been a rise in cancers diagnosed in children Most of these involve increases in the incidence of leukemias However the rate of death from cancer among children is declining Ries noted Ries noted that the reasons for the increase in childhood cancers isnt clear Among men the overall cancer rate has remained about the same In fact cancer rates in men would have also shown a decline except for a small rise in the rate of prostate cancer according to the report One section of the report focuses specifically on both brain and nervous system cancers and benign tumors According to the report benign brain tumors are twice as common as cancerous ones Ries said In fact benign brain tumors account for 75 percent of those in adults and 33 percent of brain tumors in children Cancer is not one disease Ries said The rates for some are going up and some are going down and there are different patterns for men and for women she said For example Among men rates of lung colon rectum oral pharynx stomach and brain cancers have dropped But rates of kidney pancreas and liver cancers and melanoma have risen While among women rates of breast lung colorectal uterine cervical bladder and oral cancers have dropped But rates of kidney pancreas and thyroid cancers and leukemias and melanomas have risen Racial disparities in cancer still exist the researchers noted and the cancer death rate is highest among black men and women even though the cancer death rate for blacks dropped significantly from 1998 to 2007 In addition the highest rates of new cancers seen between 2003 and 2007 was among black men Among women the highest rate was seen among white women according to the report Among both black and white women breast cancer was the most commonly diagnosed cancer These differences may be due to variations in risk behaviors socioeconomic status and access to and use of screening and treatment the researchers said Dr Joseph Rosenblatt interim director of the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine attributes declining cancer rates and deaths to a variety of factors The reduction in the rate of some cancers is mostly due to lifestyle changes especially people not smoking he said On cutting the death rate Rosenblatt noted that we have evolved better screening better diagnostics and better classification of cancers and better treatments he said We are beginning to see significant decreases On the other hand we really dont have a good explanation for why childhood cancers have increased Rosenblatt said Most of the rise is in leukemias and the good news is that most leukemias are curable in children he said Rosenblatt expects to see even fewer cancer deaths in the future The treatments on the horizon are extraordinary he said This change is being brought about by better understandings of how different cancers work and then developing targeted treatments Rosenblatt said The war on cancer has been successful he concluded More information '

aS'Defense rests in Cuban exCIA agents perjury case\nDefense rests in Cuban exCIA agents perjury case AP EL PASO Texas AP  Attorneys for an elderly exCIA agent accused of lying to US immigration authorities about his alleged role in deadly 1997 bombings in Cuba rested their case Friday without calling their client as a witness Luis Posada Carriles attorneys called just eight witnesses in eight days  barely a third of the 23 people federal prosecutors summoned to the stand during the first 11 weeks of the oftdelayed trial Prosecutors plan to call at least one rebuttal witness Monday with closing arguments to follow Posadas face is plastered on propaganda billboards throughout his native Cuba where he is considered former President Fidel Castros longtime nemesis for the decades he spent trying to destabilize Castros regime and other communist governments in Latin America For much of that time he had Washingtons support Posada sneaked into the US in 2005 and sought political asylum and then US citizenship Prosecutors charged Posada with 11 counts of immigration fraud obstruction and perjury because they say he lied during citizenship hearings in El Paso about how he made it into the country and about having a Guatemalan passport with a false name They also say Posada failed to acknowledge planning a wave of 1997 bombings at Cuban luxury hotels and a top tourist restaurant in Havana between April and September 1997 that killed an Italian visitor and injured about a dozen other people In 1998 interviews with The New York Times Posada said he masterminded the blasts explaining that they were meant to hurt tourism in Cuba but not kill anybody He also said he was angry the attacks had not received enough media attention in the US He has since denied making those comments The defense focused on attempting to discredit key prosecution witnesses rather than telling Posadas versions of events Its final witness was Carlos Spector an El Paso attorney who has handled about 500 immigration cases including some highprofile ones involving Mexicans who have fled to the US amid their countrys bloody drug war Spector suggested US authorities entrapped Posada simply by allowing him to go through immigration hearings Posada was arrested in Panama in 2000 and imprisoned over a plot to kill Castro during a summit there He was pardoned by the Panamanian president in 2004 and turned up in the US the following March Spector testified that Posada was barred by federal statute from receiving US political asylum or citizenship because his previous conviction in Panama meant he couldnt demonstrate good moral character All the other questions he was asked during the El Paso hearings Spector said including how he slipped into the country what was his role in the 1997 Cuba bombings and why he had a Guatemalan passport were irrelevant I dont know why they got that far Spector said his case was dead on arrival The defense has long claimed the US government knew Posada wouldnt qualify for citizenship but went ahead with the interview anyway just to charge him with lying Its an argument that worked before US District Judge Kathleen Cardone threw out original perjury and immigration fraud charges against Posada in 2007 chastising the government for using the immigration hearings to build a criminal case against him That decision was overturned by an appeals court however and the case returned to Cardone in El Paso where prosecutors added new charges of obstruction Posada was denied political asylum and citizenship during the El Paso proceedings but wasnt forced to leave the country under the convention to prevent torture A US immigration judge ruled he couldnt be sent to Venezuela or Cuba because he could be tortured and no other nation would take him Under crossexamination Friday lead prosecutor Timothy Reardon stressed that Posada requested the citizenship interviews and though he ultimately withdrew his application for asylum because of his Panamanian conviction he didnt do so until after answering more than two days of questions voluntarily The defense also showed a photograph of Posada in front of a Greyhound bus station but provided no further information or details Posada says he paid a people smuggler to drive him from Honduras through Mexico and over the Texas border to Houston in 2005 where he took a bus to Miami Prosecutors say he actually sailed on a friends yacht from the Mexican resort of Isla Mujeres directly to Miami where he slipped ashore without contacting immigration authorities A CIA operative until 1976 Posada participated indirectly in the failed Bay of Pigs invasion He later served as head of the Venezuelan governments intelligence service and was arrested for planning the 1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner that killed 73 people He escaped from a Venezuelan prison while still facing trial however In the 1980s he helped the US funnel support to Contra rebels in Nicaragua Since arriving in the six years ago Posada spent about two years in immigration detention centers in and near El Paso  but was released when Cardone threw out the first case against him in 2007 He has been living in Miami since then '

aS'FDA Panel Delays Action on Dyes Used in Foods\nIt calls for more research but many parents and scientists fear link to ADHD THURSDAY March 31 HealthDay News  Foods that contain dyes used to enhance color dont need warning labels a US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel said Thursday The advisers 86 vote came in response to concerns especially from parents that the commonly used dyes might be linked to attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder ADHD in some children The advisory panel made its recommendation based on the FDAs evaluation of existing data as well as testimony from researchers It was the lack of rigorous studies as well as a lack of data that prompted the panel to ask for more research into the issue and delay a recommendation on artificial food colorings CNN reported The issue pitted the food industry against some parents public watchdog groups and academics whove long agitated for a closer look at the additives The FDA advisers concluding two days of hearings that featured parents scientists and foodindustry representatives said there wasnt enough evidence to definitively say that food dyes contribute to ADHD The FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its advisory panels but it usually does so Artificial dyes are added to many foods including JELLO Lucky Charms PopTarts Nestles Butterfinger bars Hostess Twinkies and FritoLay Doritos to name a few according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest The FDA does have regulatory authority over food additives For example in 1976 Red No 2 was banned because it might be cancercausing This weeks meeting was significant because it was the first time the FDA has acknowledged that food dyes may affect children in a limited way said Dr David Schab a psychiatric researcher and an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center and the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City Schab who was scheduled to testify at the hearing called it a big step forward The question the panel was dealing with was whether the dyes cause ADHD or might they simply trigger some nonspecific behaviors such as irritability and insomnia Schab said Jeff Cronin a spokesman for the Center for Science in the Public Interest which has long lobbied for a ban on the dyes said the evidence that artificial food dyes worsen some childrens behavior is pretty convincing Cronin had hoped that the FDA panel would recommend warning labels on foods with these additives and encourage companies to switch to safer colorings Given the studies done so far Schab said he also favored eliminating artificial colorings from foods I would like the FDA to eliminate dyes but I would also be very happy if we would have a label warning like the ones that protect Europeans Schab added Labels that warn that these dyes have potential detrimental effects on behavior Based on its review of published studies the FDA at this point said a causal relationship between exposure to color additives and hyperactivity in children in the general population has not been established However it did go on to say that for some children with ADHD and other behavioral problems these dyes may exacerbate their problems But dyes may not be the only food additive that has this effect the FDA noted On the other side of the debate Brian Kennedy a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers Association contended that the safety of artificial colors has been affirmed through extensive review by the FDA and the European Food Safety Authority and neither agency sees the need to change current policy Kennedy added that all of the major safety bodies globally have reviewed the available science and have determined that there is no demonstrable link between artificial food colors and hyperactivity among children Another industry voice said that food aesthetics matter to American consumers In a statement David Schmidt president and CEO of the International Food Information Council said that food colors add to our enjoyment of food by maintaining or improving their appearance Without sufficient scientific evidence that a causal link truly exists between food colors and hyperactivity in children communications that suggest a link could have unintended consequences including unnecessarily frightening consumers about safe ingredients that are consumed every day he said Misguided theories dilute the impact of advice from health professionals on methods that have been found through scientific research to be truly effective in treating ADHD such as medication and behavior modification However Dr Roberto F LopezAlberola chief of pediatric neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine believes the dyes could have neurological effects on children The European Food Safety Authority has made it law that foods that contain these additives have a warning label he said This is already old news in the Old World LopezAlberola said these dyes make foods more attractive especially to children and he speculates that part of the increase in ADHD and autism has resulted from food additives Its not the sugar it could well be these colorants he said Cronin the spokesman for the Center for Science in the Public Interest said there are alternatives to chemical colorings He said that when warning labels were put on foods in Europe

aS'Man Wrongly Convicted Are Prosecutors Liable\nWhen prosecutors violate the law to deprive a person of a fair trial is vindication enough or should the prosecutors be held liable for damages This week a bitterly divided US Supreme Court all but closed the door to such lawsuits The 54 ruling came in the case of a New Orleans man who served 18 years in prison for a crime he did not commit In December of 1984 Raymond Liuzza Jr the son of a prominent New Orleans business executive was shot to death in front of his home Police acting on a tip picked up two men Kevin Freeman and John Thompson Thompson denied knowing anything about the shooting but Freeman in exchange for a oneyear prison sentence agreed to testify that he saw Thompson commit the crime Prosecutors wanted to seek the death penalty but Thompson had no record of violent felonies Then a citizen saw his photo in the newspaper and implicated him in an attempted carjacking  and prosecutors saw a way to solve their problem John Hollway who wrote a book about the case said the solution was to try the carjacking case first A conviction in the carjacking case would yield additional benefits in the subsequent murder trial Hollway observes It would discredit Thompson if he took the stand in his own defense at the murder trial so he didnt And the carjacking would be used against him during the punishment phase of the murder trial It all worked like a charm Thompson was convicted of both crimes and sentenced to death for murder An Oh My God Moment Several years later four young lawyers at the silkstocking firm of Morgan Lewis in Philadelphia took on his case pro bono But after 10 years and thousands of hours of work they had lost all their appeals including one at the US Supreme Court Two of the lawyers Michael Banks and Gordon Cooney flew to Louisiana We were literally on our way from telling John that we had failed him as his lawyers and that he was going to die Banks says And we were on our way to tell his mother and his 17yearold son that they should start planning for the execution Banks was driving while his cocounsel checked their office voicemail and learned some astonishing news Their investigator had unearthed in microfiche files a lab report to prosecutors in the carjacking A swatch of fabric stained with the carjackers blood had been tested and never produced to the defense It is an oh my God moment Banks says He says that single discovery would unravel both cases We still did not have evidence of Thompsons innocence but now we knew the DAs had played very very dirty pool and we were determined to see if there was other evidence that we could get he says There was plenty Further testing would show that the carjackers blood was Type B Thompsons was Type O And it turned out one of the prosecutors had years earlier made a deathbed confession to a colleague that he had hidden the blood report from the defense That confession too was kept secret To The Supreme Court All of this would eventually lead to reversal for both convictions and a new trial on the murder charge At that trial yet more evidence would be uncovered and presented to the jury Previously undisclosed police reports showed witnesses at the crime scene had described the shooter as 6 feet tall with closecropped hair Thompson was 5feet 8inches tall with a huge Afro The description in fact fit not Thompson but Freeman the man who had made the deal to testify against Thompson In all there would be 10 pieces of exculpatory evidence that prosecutors failed to turn over to the defense at the first murder trial At the second trial a jury acquitted Thompson after just 35 minutes of deliberation Thompson then sued New Orleans District Attorney Harry Connick and his office for failure to train prosecutors about their obligation to turn over such evidence to the defense Connicks office had previously been chastised by the Supreme Court for similar failures A jury awarded Thompson 14 million in damages But this week the US Supreme Court overturned that award Justice Clarence Thomas writing for the fivejustice majority said there was no proof of a pattern of indifference in the DAs office and that prosecutors unlike police do not need special training in such matters because they learn the rules in law school Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took the unusual step of reading her dissent from the bench to underscore her view that the deliberately indifferent attitude in the DAs office had created a tinderbox where miscarriages of justice were inevitable Many saw her dissent as a call to Congress to change the law That Is Whats Scary Thompson says hes not bitter saying he cant miss money he never had but he says he is worried about accountability for prosecutors Im disappointed that from the Supreme Court ruling  I didnt make things better I might have made things worser he says It made them really think they got permission to kill now without being held accountable That is whats scary Connick the district attorney feels vindicated by the high court ruling I think that he committed  a murder and I think that obviously we thought we had enough evidence to gain a conviction he says So I was delighted that the Supreme Court ruled in our favor '

aS'Click to Buy Vogue Bag as Magazines Become ETailers\nCorrects website name in 21st paragraph April 1 Bloomberg  Vogue and Elle have long influenced what clothes and handbags imageconscious consumers buy Now in a bid to reverse flagging sales and stay relevant fashion magazines may sell the products they feature in their articles As Apple Incs iPad and other mobile devices change the way people stay informed and shop ecommerce is creeping onto editorial agendas Fashion magazines that have gone as far as to add links on their websites to online vendors such as Yoox SpA may integrate the reading and buying experience a move that would transform the likes of Vogue and Elle from just trendsetters into virtual shopkeepers Gone are the days when consumers want to flip through the back of a magazine to find an index said Shannon Edwards European director of online shopping portal ShopStyle Combining retail and editorial is natural from an economic standpoint and natural from a consumer standpoint Hearst Magazines publisher of Cosmopolitan and Esquire will introduce a series of ecommerce partnerships this year according to David Carey president of the unit of New Yorkbased Hearst Corp Vogue Conde Nast Publications flagship fashion title allied last month with Yoox the Italian Internet clothing and accessories retailer Fashion magazines grappling with a slide in circulation and advertising revenue are looking to claw back ground lost to shopping websites such as Asos Plc and NetAPorter  owned by Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA  that are winning sales and influence Fashion brands are also elbowing their way into the market introducing digital titles like LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA has done with Nowness Fading Fortunes Fashion magazines are fighting for their lives said Uch Okonkwo executive director of Luxe Corp a consulting firm based in Paris About 157 billion was spent last year on apparel and accessories ads in US magazines  down from more than 2 billion in 2008  as luxury goods companies cut budgets or put funds elsewhere according to the Association of Magazine Media Both Hearst and Conde Nast closed magazines during the global economic crisis At Time Inc the publisher of InStyle and Essence publications ad revenue plunged 22 percent in 2009 and rebounded only 3 percent last year Parisbased Lagardere SCA which owns Elle saw a similar weak recovery in 2010 after a 24 percent drop a year earlier Fashion magazines print circulation is flat or falling as more readers move online Vogues circulation fell 15 percent in 2010 to about 125 million Elles slid about 05 percent to 111 million Audit Bureau of Circulations figures show NetAPorter Meanwhile sites such as NetAPorter are gaining ground Founded in 2000 by former fashion journalist Natalie Massenet NetAPorter was acquired last year by Richemont and features catwalk footage style tips and designer interviews as well as a catalogue of clothes and accessories Its a kind of fashion magazine of the future said Hearsts Carey We have to find a way to respond to that Turning into etailers may be challenging for magazines In addition to logistical and technological hurdles magazines may have to contend with an erosion of editorial independence Fully integrating shopping into editorial content would mean allowing readers to jump from a handbag or shoe in a photo spread to a page offering it for sale in a single click rather than forwarding them elsewhere for purchases That may be breaking the rules a little bit if advertisers are directly involved said Jonathan Reynolds a professor at the University of Oxfords Institute of Retail Management Substantial Challenge Adding content to ecommerce is easier than adding e commerce to content according to Okonkwo EBay Inc hired a former editor at Conde Nasts Lucky and Hearts Harpers Bazaar magazines as creative director for its fashion portal Building the logistics and technology required for ecommerce would be a substantial challenge for Vogue Okonkwo said Vogue isnt built to sell products she said That partly explains why magazines havent done more than add links to fashion brands ecommerce websites Harpers Bazaar partnered with NetAPorter last fall to pick out bags shoes and clothing available from the shopping site with a single click Vogue Italia and Yoox followed last month focusing on products by young designers that could be bought from Yooxs multibrand shopping site thecornercom Its not clear how revenue from the online transactions will be divided between the partners Maurie Perl a spokeswoman for Conde Nast declined to comment while Michael Volpatt a spokesman for Hearsts digital operations didnt immediately respond to requests for comment Monetizing Trust Because readers trust recommendations by magazines we have to find the proper ways to monetize that Hearsts Carey said Yooxs alliance with Vogue Italia wasnt a oneoff said Federico Marchetti chief executive officer of Yoox declining to comment further Determining who gets control of or access to user information  creditcard details addresses and surfing and shopping histories that can be used to target advertising and offers  may represent a major hurdle Retaining data from a significant number of people means youre in business for anything you want to sell said Alex Wisch a Standard  Poors Equity Research analyst in London Consumers will take time to adjust to the change according to JeanMichel Noir CEO of Redcats the online fashion and homefurnishings retailer owned by PPR SA Redcats operates two sites for its Vertbaudet brand one of which is contentbased and the other which sells products We havent merged them Noir said Im not saying this is the way we will look at things forever but its not that easy to do everything on one site Still sliding ad revenue may force fashion magazines to do just that Oxfords Reynolds said I think magazines are looking at the ad revenue shortfall and saying we need to do more  Editors Vidya Root Celeste Perri To contact the reporters on this story Andrew Roberts in Paris at aroberts36bloombergnet Matthew Campbell in Paris at

yet have her own sense of style but she loved the very theatrical fairytale dresses we made When she asked us to make her wedding dress it was lifechanging She told us to be secretive but there were no instructions from Buckingham Palace no protocol There was so much speculation in the press after she wore a gown of ours to an official dinner the Palace was forced to make an announcement through Reuters The whole world went mad There were photographers at the studio constantly and we had to take on security We left false trails for the tabloids in the rubbish bins and we locked the dress in a trunk every night We even made a spare dress in case our real design was leaked On the day itself we realised this wasnt just a wedding dress it was a moment in history We dressed her at Clarence

bride getting reeling drunk so she couldnt consummate her marriage Bruce Oldfield designer The Eighties was a showy decade I made a dress for an Australian bride in 1984 We had three appointments and each time she said the sketches werent quite right until she finally said Youve missed the point We want our guests to know weve spent an absolute bloody fortune and that this is Australias royal wedding Even three or four years after Dianas fairyprincess dress wedding gowns were changing to suit the times This Australian bride wanted the full skirt but also to be able to detach parts of the dress to reveal her very good figure there were moves afoot to sex up wedding dresses Rob Van Helden florist I started my business in 1986 Back then carnations and chrysanthemums were standard wedding flowers now theyre so unfashionable as is the way flowers were arranged then  all mixed together in one big vase People certainly didnt spend money on flowers Weddings followed a simple routine ceremony reception meal dancing The wedding party sat on a long table and the dance floor was in front of them Now the DJ is flown in from Ibiza and theres a secret nightclub revealed behind a curtain at the back of the marquee In the nineties influenced by a growing culture of conspicuous consumption weddings became more extravagant and individualised assisted by changes in the law in 1995 that meant civil ceremonies could now take place in castles hotels or stately homes Meg Matthews Noel Gallagher and I were going to get married on Valentines Day 1997 on a barge in Little Venice but it got leaked to The Sun so we had to cancel it Noel said Leave it to me We went and had our suits tailored at Daniel James in Savile Row I had an amazing white suit modelled on the one Bianca Jagger wore to marry Mick and a hat with a veil Noel said The car is picking us up in the morning Were going to get married You cant tell anyone I remember passing Kate Moss on the stairs in the morning  she was living with us at the time  and I was carrying a huge hat box in my arms I thought it was so obvious but she didnt clock it I knew we were going to Las Vegas but it was still a secret operation Noel and I flew there via Phoenix My mum and dad flew via Chicago Noels mum Peggy came via somewhere else We all met up at the Liberace suite in Caesars Palace at midnight got dressed then went to the Little Chapel of the West to get married They played The Beatles there was a beautiful big cake flowers  and bottles and bottles of chilled Cristal Even Walkers crisps It was about four in the morning by this time then we all went for steak and eggs and hit the blackjack tables It was so much fun just us our family and Noels manager and his wife There was all this rubbish printed about Noel being so drunk he couldnt remember his wedding but he wasnt even drinking I drank the Cristal For our honeymoon we went to New York Everyone flew out  Dan Macmillan Kate DJ Shadow we were all in our suite partying It wasnt about going away to a tropical island for a week  tradition wasnt in our heads It was 1997 Oasis were at the peak of their career It was rocknroll Kate Halfpenny bridal designer There were so many divorces happening in the late Eighties and early Nineties marriage just wasnt as popular as it had been Minimalism was in fashion so you had brides like Jemima Khan in her elegant dress and jacket or Carolyn BessetteKennedy in her simple white sheath dress Rob Van Helden My first huge huge wedding was that of Prince Pavlos of Greece in 1995 I had never seen a wedding like it It went on for four days and there were 1200 guests In the Nineties flowers became a luxury business The flower world became like the chef world You had your celebrity chefs and your celebrity floral designers  Phillipa Lepley bridal designer The fabrics got ever more sophisticated in the Nineties Those slubby silk dupions or rough taffetas were out The look was cleaner straighter  though brides still wore sleeves which is not the case now The new millennium After the recession of the late Nineties a bullish economy was reflected in a rise in the average wedding costs from 10k in the 1980s to 15k today giving rise to a new wedding industry worth millions of pounds  an industry which was quick to capitalise on the new laws regarding civil partnerships passed in 2005 for gay couples celebrated memorably by the wedding of Sir Elton John to David Furnish Alice du Parq Brides Magazine Martha Stewart launched her magazine in the US in 1994 It took a few years but by the beginning of the Noughties her influence was being felt in the UK too Here was a new way to do weddings  personalised bespoke hyperindividualised  which focused on making a visual impression Couples began to create a continuous theme between the venue flowers cake bridesmaids cocktail and table dcor Fiona Leahy event planner A lot of upscale modern weddings are a form of branding  theyre a way for a couple to impart and share with guests their personal taste The first wedding I organised was for Dita Von Teese and Marilyn Manson Their stamp was on everything It wasnt all plastic bats and striptease it was chic and quite Victorian in style Couples are far more imaginative now with their weddings  especially since theres no pressure to get married at home Huge numbers of couples now marry abroad in France Italy Barbados Bruce Oldfield Everything has become more casual in our society so of course couples want their wedding to be less formal just as every generation wants less formality than the previous generation Its an easing up of the rigours  which in a bride means not having to have a veil over her face or wear a tiara Now a wedding is as much about the ceremony as it is about dancing and having a good time with friends Nicky Haslam People clap in church now when the couple kiss Its a completely new invention You never had guests taking cameras into the church taking pictures of the bride as she walked up the aisle Nor would you have brides in strapless dresses in the church Weddings have become more of a public spectacle Theyre more a reason for everyone to get pissed And they go on far too long  some are sevenhour marathons Kate Halfpenny No bride wants that strapless Aline dress that was so popular five years ago Very few brides want a corset either because there is now this obsession with being comfortable on your wedding day Veils have become very unpopular theyre seen as too oldfashioned Which is funny because vintage has been for the past 10 years a huge trend in fashion Some mothers of the bride I see absolutely adore the vintage dresses I make because they remind them of what they wore themselves on their wedding day Others hate them for the exact same reason Although brides are older now and some onto their second or third marriages so their mothers have far less say in what they wear  Ive dressed brides for synagogue ceremonies who were definitely showing cleavage Alice du Parq Princess Diana was just 20 when she got married Its rare for a bride to be that young now  the average bride in the UK is 34 Todays 20yearold is carving out a career or finishing university dating and figuring out the type of woman she wants to be Shes not thinking about being someones wife Most couples live together for years before they decide to marry It means that wedding lists have changed too people already have the kettle and toaster by the time they walk down the aisle  Tom Konig Oppenheimer coowner of PR firm The Communications Store When the civil partnership law changed we initially didnt want to get married  Adam and I have been together for 14 years we didnt feel the need But then we thought actually its an honour especially because for decades our type couldnt be recognised like that It was a first for everyone including us Wed never been to a gay wedding so we made it up from scratch We married at Chelsea registry office then we had 130 for dinner at Tramps I was working with Abercrombie  Fitch at the time I thought if were going to be gay we might as well be really gay so we got the Abercrombie male models to come and serve vodka seminaked I had recently won Thandie Newton at an auction  so she sang after dinner Simon Sebag Montefiore wrote the evening up for The Spectator God knows what they thought and Vogue covered it too  it was the first time theyd featured a gay wedding It was a lovely joyous night As the decade progressed celebrity coverage became allpervasive couples could now imitate the weddings they saw in glossy magazines And with the advance of the internet into our lives couples could now access vast amounts of information  locations flowers food themes  making the choice in how they wed almost infinite Rob Van Helden Ive done a few footballers and celebrity weddings that have been covered in Hello You have to keep the flowers under sheets to stop the paparazzi at the door from spying Brides often come to me with pictures of Hollywood weddings  though they dont realise quite how much those American florists charge With the vast scope of magazines and the internet theres so much more choice and brides have become more choosy Its no coincidence that the term Bridezilla has come about Fiona Leahy The internet has made weddings more egalitarian Unless you were royalty you wouldnt have your own monogram on your wedding invitation Now with computergenerated software you can make your own Its given couples more freedom to be individual and creative It follows from the way we live now we blog we Tweet Its all about selfdefinition Weddings became increasingly lavish until in 2007 the credit crunch strikes Rob Van Helden The buildup of spending power up till 2007 was incredible It was all about more more more and God did you go to that wedding where there were 20000 white roses Then we were all brought back down to earth People have started to believe in the elegance of a wedding the simplicity That less is more Its all about a more relaxed sensibility at weddings now Fiona Leahy At a wedding in the Middle East I organised as favours for the guests mahogany boxes containing individual perfume bottles from Henry Jacques in Paris worth 500 each Another occasion I had to track down albino peacocks for an allwhite themed reception Ive had to fly wedding cakes business class in their own seats and send a driver to France to pick up foie gras for a wedding in Scotland But Im finding fewer people want to be ostentatious in that way now People still want to be opulent but in a less showy manner Bruce Oldfield I opened my shop in Beauchamp Place in late 2009 The first six months were very very quiet People were tightening their belts downscaling their weddings There was suddenly something vulgar about spending masses of money on a single day Vicky Ward writer I wrote a book about Lehman Brothers In August 2008 a seniorlevel banker at the firm had rented the biggest most expensive house in St Tropez for his wedding It was filled with his bride and all their guests including those hed flown over from the States at great expense not least the photographer Terry Richardson who was there to take their wedding pictures But where was the groom Stuck in New York with a broken leg and the shit about to hit the fan at Lehmans No one in that office was going anywhere In the end he got the red eye over to France hobbled up the aisle  still wearing the clothes he flew in  saidhis vows then got straight back on a plane and went home God only knows how much money was wasted Lehmans went down on 15 September Talk about wedding of the moment In reaction to the extravagance and in line with Britains growing ecoawareness weddings moved towards more lowkey celebrations Mimicking the bohemian atmosphere of a music festival  or the traditional village fte  country weddings became all the rage Kate Halfpenny The press say that Im making Kate Mosss wedding dress  Im not I wouldnt be surprised if she had a quintessentially English wedding teepees in an apple orchard fairy lights but with a rocknroll party edge That kind of English wedding feels more modern than hiring the Dorchester and a sitdown dinner for 150 On 29 april Prince William will marry Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey Vicky Ward I think its admirable William and Kate are conscious of austerity Britain but this wedding is important for the world No one will replace Diana but Kate is the fairy tale again Theres no obscure Whatever love is with this couple they really do seem to be in love And everyone wants a wedding that reflects that Were in need of a fairy tale Bruce Oldfield Royal weddings tend to be predictable and this one will be predictable in so far as there are things that have to be done in ways that are set But there will certainly be some surprises Were making quite a lot of things for the bridal party People are going for it  hat makers are busy shoemakers are busy glove makers are busy No one does a wedding like the English '

aS'The Saturday interview Pearl and Daisy Lowe\nPearl Lowe spent the mid90s in a whirl of endless parties that led to addiction and depression But she and her daughter Daisy are now a major force in fashion writes Amy Raphael Last September a 35 vintage black polyester dress with a cream lace trim caused the kind of fuss in the fashion world usually reserved for Kate Mosss collections for Topshop Designed by Pearl Lowe once a minor Britpop star the dress sold out in two hours Peacocks a budget retailer that managed to be around for over a century without generating much fuss had to set up a waiting list for the first time in its history Courtney Love tweeted a message to Lowe asking for a dress to be couriered to her New York hotel Natalie Imbruglia and Sharleen Spiteri managed to get hold of one And after waiting for a few weeks television presenter Holly Willoughby wore hers on This Morning Lowes new collection for Peacocks  a black dress with lace bows a simple floral dress a polkadot dress  was launched this week Fashion writers blogged and tweeted about the vintagestyle dresses for weeks in advance The collections sell so well because they are easy to wear and hugely flattering with sleeves and nippedin waists they come in sizes 8 to 18 and manage to look unique like great fleamarket finds The fact Lowe is so well connected helps too Before moving to a big house in Somerset with her family  she is married to Supergrass drummer Danny Goffey  she was part of the mid90s Primrose Hill set that included Kate Moss Sadie Frost Sienna Miller Jude Law and Rhys Ifans It helps too that Lowes daughter Daisy is a supermodel who has modelled her last two Peacocks collections Daisy is equally well connected her friend Alexa Chung bought the black polyester dress and she is a regular on the catwalks of Vivienne Westwood and Chanel shows Daisy has been modelling since she was signed by Select at 15 and at 22 is the height of cool Pearl Lowe reinvented herself a decade ago when she started designing lace curtains and cushions since 2006 she has been making handmade dresses first for Libertys and then for small London boutiques She has always been a gifted selfpublicist inviting endless magazines and newspapers into her country house and appearing on the front of Hello with Daisy when she married Goffey in late 2008 The press both tabloids and broadsheets has in turn been infatuated with Pearl for more than a decade There has been a kind of carcrash fascination with Pearls endless public discussion of her addiction to cocaine and heroin Harriet Quick fashion features director of Vogue says that the raw material of Pearl and Daisys story is not great its not as though Pearl married Keith Richards But she adds in the last five years fashion has opened up and its become easier for people to think I can do a line We are following on from America where everyone wants to make a buck out of fashion And the fact that Pearl also has a back from hell story obviously touches people When I meet Pearl for lunch at Babington House a private members club near her Somerset home she has been talking for less than 10 minutes before suddenly announcing Ive been six years sober Six years Theres no one around to overhear such a declaration Perhaps Pearl 40 is not so much telling the world as herself as a recovering addict she needs to keep celebrating her sobriety She certainly looks great with those big generous eyes a long bob and a dog walkers lithe body She sips orange juice and texts Daisy who is in her room with her boyfriend Matt Smith taking a nap Pearl and Daisy are a unique motherdaughter act Pearl is married to a rock star albeit the drummer of a band that no longer exists while Daisy is dating the incumbent Doctor Who Matt Smith Yet the reality of their relationship is not cool at all as Daisy was growing up Pearl was regularly taking drugs It defines each of them to a degree it makes you wonder if Daisy is angry And yet here she is drifting through the restaurant in a pretty dress tights black boots and a battered expensivelooking leather jacket She kisses her mum hugs her tight and steals her orange juice When dressed up for fashion shoots Daisy is often overtly sexual and provocative today she is virtually free of makeup and ridiculously beautiful They chat for a while as though alone Pearl Did you hang out in the bar last night Daisy No we had dinner and went to bed We were supposed to watch the Banksy film and Black Swan and go for a night walk But we just fell asleep I woke up at 530am and all the lights were on the curtains were open  She gasps Ohmigod we found two frogs in our room one on top of the other I think it was a baby frog and a mother frog They were really cute but we had to pick them up and take them outside Well Matt had to She catches herself glances at me its clear that Smith is out of bounds Pearl oblivious keeps on chatting Im so happy Daisy isnt like I used to be I dont just mean not going to the bar last night but her general lack of interest in big nights out Daisy smiles Im always calling mum and saying I dont want to go to this party do I have to go Dont get me wrong I like to have a good party sometimes But I really like having my friends over cooking for them dancing and then doing some painting Its a really good night in   It doesnt sound very rocknroll If youre talking about drugs they dont agree with me Im too sensitive for them It seems that Daisy rebelled against her mum and Danny whom Pearl met when Daisy was six by deciding to be resolutely straight Pearl has three children with Goffey  Alfie 14 Frankie 11 and Betty 5  and has been sober only since conceiving Betty NME used to make nasty jokes about her giving birth to Alfie in the toilets of the Dublin Castle pub in Camden For many years taking drugs with a host of other north London celebrities was part of Pearls life She insists however that her kids were oblivious to the drugs People used to be round at ours all night and then Danny would start ordering cabs while I opened the windows lit the Diptyque candles and got the Hoover out At 6am Id finally go to bed and then get up and take the kids to school I ask Daisy what this was like for her I was aware there were lots of cool people in the house I had no idea mum was doing drugs Pearl continues When Daisy was 16 she asked me if Id ever smoked spliff   Daisy smiles and pokes at her green minestrone soup It has been suggested in other interviews that Pearl was often so out of it that Daisy had to look after Alfie and then Frankie changing their nappies and feeding them Daisy laid back until now sits up straight and almost shouts No no no Ive always talked about having a strong maternal instinct  when Mum was pregnant with Alfie everyone kept saying that I was going to be really jealous of the baby I took it upon myself to go against what everyone expected and look after him I would always wake up early  as young kids do  and give him formula watch Rugrats with him Pearl Bearing in mind Id have done the night feeds with him Daisy shrugging I was just trying to be a nice daughter If this is wellrehearsed PR banter it doesnt feel like it Possibly because as the conversation continues it becomes clear that it has taken hard work for Pearl and Daisy to be so close Pearl has always struggled with depression when Frankie was five she sought help in a clinic It wasnt easy Danny was away on tour with Supergrass so much and looking after the kids was down to me I was dreadfully unhappy Eventually she began to realise that she had to leave London the drugs the social life the madness She found a house to rent in Hampshire and was all set to leave when Daisy then 15 announced she wasnt coming It was the worst period of my entire life says Pearl I can seriously say that I felt like ending it all I didnt want to split my family up I knew that if I stayed in London I wouldnt survive Daisy edges first towards her mother and then to the other end of the table where she spears broccoli as she talks But I didnt understand that I was only 15 I was a pain in the arse but I didnt want you to go I didnt want you to leave London We had to keep talking and talking but it was   She drifts off Lets just say theres been a lot of healing since then Daisy moved in with her maternal grandmother got a Saturday job at Agent Provocateur and signed to Select Models To the outside world it looked as though Daisys life was charmed The reality was much more complicated For years she had wanted to know who her biological dad was Pearl had assumed it was Bronner Handwerger a holistic doctor now based in San Diego with whom she had a short relationship But Daisy worked out that because of their respective blood groups he couldnt be Pearl puts her hand on Daisys arm and says softly In a way I was too scared to find out I kept thinking it was too late but its never too late Pearl suspected it might be Gavin Rossdale a British rock star now living in LA who was once her best friend I kept looking at Daisys eyes and nose and thinking I couldnt live a lie any more So when Daisy was 15 Rossdale took a paternity test and discovered he was her father Pearl says Rossdale has refused to talk to her since finding out  I lost a best friend but found the truth  while Daisy is in regular contact with him She looks at her mum I hate the fact that you two dont get on It would make life a lot easier and brighter if you did I ask Daisy if she too suffers from depression Ive definitely got it in me Im better than Ive ever been Ive given myself a hard time in the past youve got a lovely family a great boyfriend great friends a great job  its so out of order for you to feel this way As soon as I stood up and stared it in the face I accepted it It flies away a lot faster Out of the window I spot Smith striding up and down the lawn learning his lines for the next series of Doctor Who Daisy stares out of the window and smiles Aaaah bless him We all three gaze at him for a moment Daisy pulls herself away first Mum and Danny did everything they could for us sending us to the best schools making lovely family dinners letting us have friends round encouraging us to be open Granted my childhood wasnt conventional but it was full of love If ever Im in trouble I ring my mum She knows me better than anyone and has great life experience There is no one else that can fix problems like she does In 2007 Pearl wrote a memoir of addiction All That Glitters about the years in London that almost killed her She still grimaces when talking about those hazy years and how she wasnt the best mother I could be With anyone else this might be maddening but with Pearl the sentiment is so heartfelt its hard to feel angry although you do wonder if she will ever be at peace with herself A little later I see Pearl Daisy and Smith huddled together at one end of a bench in the garden Its the first warm day of the year and theres no reason for them all to be sitting so close together and they have no idea I can see them Whatever Pearl may have done wrong she also did something right '

week we reported that many of the real names posted on Porn Wikileaks were stolen from the patient database of the private clinic that runs STD tests for Californias porn industry The news quickly thrust the site into the spotlight but the leak has been casting a silent shadow over the industry for months whispered about on blogs and forums Everyone knows it exists but 99 of the blogs and other forums never mention their name said porn industry blogger Darrah Ford We dont want to give owner publicity Porn Wikileaks is not Wikileaks for the porn industry though theyd like you to believe it In fact their mission statement is plagiarized directly from the real Wikileaks website Its more like an online slam book a repository of facts gossip and lies deployed strategically to intimidate and punish anyone who crosses the awful hive of homophobic cyberstalkers that run the site Their weapon is a useredited wiki of more than 12000 performers Most of the entries are just oneline long with a stage name real name and date of birth presented via a boilerplate message Soandso is a pornographic whore and Hooker But some entries are astonishingly complete resembling a guide to aspiring

check as proof When she refused they turned on her scouring the web for information and filling out her wiki to punish her Some users changed their avatars to photoshopped pictures of her and her parents The harassment spilled into the real world They called my work they tried to call my dads house Foster told us At this point I was paranoid and afraid that someone might show up at my apartment complex and try to hurt me Foster said shes contacted the FBI but they havent been able to do much since the site is hosted in the Netherlands The identities of everyone involved in Porn

aS'US Cancer Rates Continue to Fall\nReport suggests that better screening diagnosis and treatments are paying off THURSDAY March 31 HealthDay News  The rate of new cancers in the United States has dropped by almost 1 percent a year and the rate of death from cancer has fallen 16 percent a year a new report shows These declines seen between 2003 and 2007 continue a trend that began in the 1990s the researchers added Importantly this is the first time a drop in the rate of deaths from lung cancer among women has been seen coming a decade after lung cancer death rates started declining in men they noted The drop in lung cancer rates among women is due to women quitting smoking said report coauthor Lynn Ries a health statistician at the US National Cancer Institute Women started smoking a lot later than men so the peak in the mortality rate occurred a lot later she added The report is the work of researchers at the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries the US National Cancer Institute the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Cancer Society It is published in the March 31 online edition of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute  Although cancer rates are declining in adults there has been a rise in cancers diagnosed in children Most of these involve increases in the incidence of leukemias However the rate of death from cancer among children is declining Ries noted Ries noted that the reasons for the increase in childhood cancers isnt clear Among men the overall cancer rate has remained about the same In fact cancer rates in men would have also shown a decline except for a small rise in the rate of prostate cancer according to the report One section of the report focuses specifically on both brain and nervous system cancers and benign tumors According to the report benign brain tumors are twice as common as cancerous ones Ries said In fact benign brain tumors account for 75 percent of those in adults and 33 percent of brain tumors in children Cancer is not one disease Ries said The rates for some are going up and some are going down and there are different patterns for men and for women she said For example Among men rates of lung colon rectum oral pharynx stomach and brain cancers have dropped But rates of kidney pancreas and liver cancers and melanoma have risen While among women rates of breast lung colorectal uterine cervical bladder and oral cancers have dropped But rates of kidney pancreas and thyroid cancers and leukemias and melanomas have risen Racial disparities in cancer still exist the researchers noted and the cancer death rate is highest among black men and women even though the cancer death rate for blacks dropped significantly from 1998 to 2007 In addition the highest rates of new cancers seen between 2003 and 2007 was among black men Among women the highest rate was seen among white women according to the report Among both black and white women breast cancer was the most commonly diagnosed cancer These differences may be due to variations in risk behaviors socioeconomic status and access to and use of screening and treatment the researchers said Dr Joseph Rosenblatt interim director of the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine attributes declining cancer rates and deaths to a variety of factors The reduction in the rate of some cancers is mostly due to lifestyle changes especially people not smoking he said On cutting the death rate Rosenblatt noted that we have evolved better screening better diagnostics and better classification of cancers and better treatments he said We are beginning to see significant decreases On the other hand we really dont have a good explanation for why childhood cancers have increased Rosenblatt said Most of the rise is in leukemias and the good news is that most leukemias are curable in children he said Rosenblatt expects to see even fewer cancer deaths in the future The treatments on the horizon are extraordinary he said This change is being brought about by better understandings of how different cancers work and then developing targeted treatments Rosenblatt said The war on cancer has been successful he concluded More information '

color dont need warning labels a US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel said Thursday The advisers 86 vote came in response to concerns especially from parents that the commonly used dyes might be linked to attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder ADHD in some children The advisory panel made its recommendation based on the FDAs evaluation of existing data as well as testimony from researchers It was the lack of rigorous studies as well as a lack of data that prompted the panel to ask for more research into the issue and delay a recommendation on artificial food colorings CNN reported The issue pitted the food industry against some parents public watchdog groups and academics whove long agitated for a closer look at the additives The FDA advisers concluding two days of hearings that featured parents scientists and foodindustry representatives said there wasnt enough evidence to definitively say that food dyes contribute to ADHD The FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its advisory panels but it usually does so Artificial dyes are added to many foods including JELLO Lucky Charms PopTarts Nestles Butterfinger bars Hostess Twinkies and FritoLay Doritos to name a few according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest The FDA does have regulatory authority over food additives For example in 1976 Red No 2 was banned because it might be cancercausing This weeks meeting was significant because it was the first time the FDA has acknowledged that food dyes may affect children in a limited way said Dr David Schab a psychiatric researcher and an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center and the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City Schab who was scheduled to testify at the hearing called it a big step forward The question the panel was dealing with was whether the dyes cause ADHD or might they simply trigger some nonspecific behaviors such as irritability and insomnia Schab said Jeff Cronin a spokesman for the Center for Science in the Public Interest which has long lobbied for a ban on the dyes said the evidence that artificial food dyes worsen some childrens behavior is pretty convincing Cronin had hoped that the FDA panel would recommend warning labels on foods with these additives and encourage companies to switch to safer colorings Given the studies done so far Schab said he also favored eliminating artificial colorings from foods I would like the FDA to eliminate dyes but I would also be very happy if we would have a label warning like the ones that protect Europeans Schab added Labels that warn that these dyes have potential detrimental effects on behavior Based on its review of published studies the FDA at this point said a causal relationship between exposure to color additives and hyperactivity in children in the general population has not been established However it did go on to say that for some children with ADHD and other behavioral problems these dyes may exacerbate their problems But dyes may not be the only food additive that has this effect the FDA noted On the other side of the debate Brian Kennedy a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers Association contended that the safety of artificial colors has been affirmed through extensive review by the FDA and the European Food Safety Authority and neither agency sees the need to change current policy Kennedy added that all of the major safety bodies globally have reviewed the available science and have determined that there is no demonstrable link between artificial food colors and hyperactivity among children Another industry voice said that food aesthetics matter to American consumers In a statement David Schmidt president and CEO of the International Food Information Council said that food colors add to our enjoyment of food by maintaining or improving their appearance Without sufficient scientific evidence that a causal link truly exists between food colors and hyperactivity in children communications that suggest a link could have unintended consequences including unnecessarily frightening consumers about safe ingredients that are consumed every day he said Misguided theories dilute the impact of advice from health professionals on methods that have been found through scientific research to be truly effective in treating ADHD such as medication and behavior modification However Dr Roberto F LopezAlberola chief of pediatric neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine believes the dyes could have neurological effects on children The European Food Safety Authority has made it law that foods that contain these additives have a warning label he said This is already old news in the Old World LopezAlberola said these dyes make foods more attractive especially to children and he speculates that part of the increase in ADHD and autism has resulted from food additives Its not the sugar it could well be these colorants he said Cronin the spokesman for the Center for Science in the Public Interest said there are alternatives to chemical colorings He said that when warning labels were put on foods in Europe it caused many USbased food companies to market naturalbased foodcolored products in Europe More information '

aS'GOP Launching MultiPronged Attack On Senior Citizens\nThis one truly has me scratching my head In the 2010 midterm elections the GOP successfully garnered the vote of the nations seniors by a 21 margin Not bad considering that this demographic is one of the most reliable groups of voters in any national state or local election While the elderly have gravitated to the Republican Party for some time now the fear the GOP has been sewing within this community over the Medicare cuts coming from Obamacare was all it really took to deliver these very healthy voter margins around the country  never mind that the Republicans achieved this success by mischaracterizing the Medicare cuts at every opportunity in the effort to frighten the nations seniors Yet for reasons that boggle the rational mind seniors have now become a target of both the GOP budgeting process and the House Ways And Means Committee First the budget It is no great surprise that House GOP budget maven Rep Paul Ryan RWisconsin is expected to announce the GOP plan to cut 1 trillion in Medicaid over the next ten years While these cuts will bring devastating consequences to the nations poor and disabled protecting the needs of the poor has never been a priority with the GOP What does surprise is that Ryan has indicated that he intends to additionally propose some large cuts in Medicare  although he is being somewhat cagey about letting on just how large those cuts will be While the expectation is that Ryan will suggest a voucher system whereby seniors will be given government checks to use in purchasing their medical care checks that remain static or rise via cost of living adjustments despite the fact that medical costs tend to increase at a rate well in excess of the cost of living well all have to wait and see as the Congressman is not giving away many details Of course who can blame Ryan for being vague on the Medicare cut numbers as the nations senior citizens and the AARP  are not likely to take the news very well Still knowing what is coming it seems reasonable to wonder what is to become of our senior citizens when these voucher checks no longer cover the costs of serious illness As noted opponents of health care reform never miss an opportunity to remind our seniors that the ACA legislated away some 500 billion in Medicare money However these cuts were largely the result of ending the 11 premium the government has been paying to Medicare Advantage programs for the identical services provided to Medicare beneficiaries when paid for directly from the government program This premium charge was not an accident When the Medicare Advantage program was created  in the effort to move the administration of Medicare to the private sector  the insurance companies asked the government to subsidize their efforts until they could get their respective programs up on their feet They also promised that they would have these programs running efficiently by 2010 when the subsidy was scheduled to come to an end Thus the largest chunk of cuts in the Medicare budget resulting from the ACA comes from ending the corporate subsidy that was already scheduled to end in 2010 As a result none of these cuts legislated in the ACA mean any loss of important medical care to our elderly How the Republicans plan to cut further into Medicare without obliterating essential health care benefits should be an interesting exercise and one that could send seniors running back to the Democratic Party in droves  and the Republicans know it Which is why the GOP has chosen this moment to seek to discredit the AARP the primary lobby for the nations elderly This week when the Ways and Means Committee released its report Behind the Veil The AARP America Doesnt Know Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Charles Boustany RLa suggested that the senior citizen lobbys commercial activities interfere with its taxexempt status and he called for an investigation by the Internal Revenue Service to determine whether the groups privileged status ought to be revoked Via Politico The report pulls no punches when arguing that AARP is a primary beneficiary of Obamacare in that the end of Medicare Advantage programs and the overcharges to the taxpayers that comes with them will result in an increase in the supplemental Medicare policies that AARP endorses Republicans argue that AARP supported a provision in the overhaul that cut 200 billion from the Medicare Advantage program because the group will benefit when seniors replace their coverage with supplemental Medicare policies  known as Medigap policies  that the group endorses Via California Healthline Sour grapes anybody So intent is the GOP in punishing AARP for its support of health care reform that they now seek to pull the organizations taxexempt status as payback  virtually guaranteeing some nasty blowback from the key senior voting demographic If this isnt a messaging opportunity that even Democrats cant screw up I dont know what is Welcome back senior citizens of America It was only a matter of time until those who have pretended to care about your well being managed to reveal themselves and show you who really has your back '

aS'Quotes of the day\nTim Pawlenty is making a list of potential running mates Asked for his top five vice presidential picks Pawlenty didnt hesitate in naming Florida Sen Marco Rubio New Jersey Gov Chris Christie Ohio Gov John Kasich Nevada Gov Brian Sandoval and New Mexico Gov Susana Martinez  Its difficult at this point to try to determine who has the best chance to be the Republican candidate in the 2012 election Still its fair to say that Tim Pawlenty could pursue a potentially successful Goldilocks Strategy for the nomination It would be very difficult to win merely by mobilizing the very conservative party base Mathematically speaking it is possible but in practice multiple candidates tend to be in competition for that bloc which means the ultimate winner will probably have to string together a voting coalition that samples from the more moderate factions There are of course many ways to skin this cat  and George W Bushs coalition in 2000 was more conservative than McCains in 2008  but the point is that whichever mix you put together Pawlenty or any other candidate will need some kind of mix And it would be very difficult to win the nomination without getting at least 15 percent of either the very conservative or the moderate faction In other words candidates who can pursue a Goldilocks strategy can be favored  those who come across as not too conservative or too moderate but fall somewhere in between And on this front Pawlenty might be able to carve out a real niche for himself  Over the course of the last five months PPP has polled Republican voters in 16 different states that had primaries or caucuses while Romney was still in the race for President in 2008 Comparing the support Romney received then to the support he has now does not present a pretty picture for his chances at winning the nomination On average he is doing 14 points worse than he did in his first campaign These numbers suggest that little of the support he received in 2008 was hard and that with a different field of candidates he could have difficulty getting the same people who voted for him the first time around to do it again I dont know whether these declining numbers for Romney are because voters have actually turned against him over the last three years or because he was more of a default choice they werent terribly enthused about in the first place but they certainly show he hasnt been making a whole lot of new friends since his last bid  I see three factors and all have to be in place and reinforce each other for Obama to lose First the economy in 2012 has to be either stagnant or in decline in the 10 or so key electoral states especially the ones in the Midwest as he heads into the election This would mean that the economy is creating very few net jobs in 2012 and that prices including food and gas are still rising Second no new major international crisis arises that causes people to rally behind Obama because of his competent handling of it And I emphasize the words new major and competent Afghanistan and Iraq devolving again into a problem will not help Obama and actually may hurt him because our country has basically moved on from the situation in both places Third a Republican nominee has to emerge who is charismatic is a very good communicator is in touch with the countrys economic and social needs and is a new brand of GOP leader whom many younger voters can connect with Think of what it took in 1980 to defeat the Democratic incumbent  Ronald Reagan and crises galore  I think what the younger voters have figured out is that this is a broken relationship He made soaring promises and grand expectations Hes broken those promises Pawlenty told the crowd of students If this was a Lady Gaga song the relationship between the youth vote and Barack Obama would be Bad Romance Pawlenty Minnesotas most recent former governor and a potential future presidential hopeful said the news of the day has been dominated by the tragedy in Japan issues in the Middle East and Charlie Sheen We may not in this room have tiger blood like he does Pawlenty said referring to the television actor but weve got something else in common with him Theres going to be a lot of winning on the Republican side in 2012  Pawlenty is viewed by many GOP Insiders as the 2012 contender with the least political baggage who has positioned himself as a candidate with the broadest appeal to the party conservative base from tea party supporters to values voters Increasingly the choice by processofelimination noted one Republican Insider His strategy is to be the least offensive of the ugly girls still standing at the bar at 2 am joked another GOP Insider '

aS'William Hague statement Diplomats expelled from Libyan embassy in London\nThe Government has expelled five diplomats from the Libyan embassy in London because they could pose a threat to national security The move was revealed by William Hague in another emergency statement on the military action to the Commons this afternoon The Foreign Secretary told MPs the five included the military attache as he updated the House on yesterdays summit in the capital His statement came after David Cameron said during PMQs that Britain had not ruled out providing arms to rebels in the country British warplanes have now flown more than 160 missions over Libya as they police the nofly zone enforced against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi More than 350 planes from 15 nations have been committed to the effort with vessels from 10 countries supporting the arms embargo Mr Hague said The situation on the ground remains fluid Regime forces have intensified their attacks driving back opposition forces from ground they had taken in recent days Misrata also came under heavy attack yesterday with further loss of civilian life including children from mortars sniper fire and attacks on all sides from regime tanks and personnel carriers One obstacle to humanitarian support for the people of Misrata has been regime vessels trying to blockade the port These vessels were attacked by coalition aircraft yesterday Four of them were sunk and one vessel was beached It was confirmed that a British diplomatic mission headed by UK ambassador to Italy Christopher Prentice visited Benghazi on Monday and Tuesday to meet opposition groups including the INC and its military council Mr Hague said The London conference showed that we are united in our aims  seeking a Libya that does not pose a threat to its own citizens or to the region and in working with the people of Libya as they choose their own way forward to a peaceful and stable future And it demonstrated that clear international support for the people of Libya With that support there is every prospect of focused and sustained assistance to the people of Libya as they seek to determine their own future Earlier Mr Cameron said the UN resolution permitting action in Libya would not necessarily rule out arming rebels fighting Gaddafi The PM was asked by Labour leader Ed Miliband whether the terms of the resolution 1973 override the arms embargo imposed by the earlier resolution 1970 He replied I have said before in the House that we must do everything to comply with both the Security Council resolutions The arms embargo applies to the whole of the territory of Libya but at the same time UN Security Council resolution 1973 allows all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilianpopulated areas Our view is that this would not necessarily rule out the provision of assistance to those protecting civilians in certain circumstances We do not rule it out but we have not taken the decision to do so Former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell warned that extreme caution must be taken on the issue Mr Cameron said any decision to supply arms would have to be considered with due care as there were some very strong arguments on both sides US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in London for the summit suggested yesterday that it would be legal to arm the rebels It is our interpretation that 1973 amended or overrode the absolute prohibition on arms to anyone in Libya so that there could be a legitimate transfer of arms if a country should choose to do that she said Meanwhile Italian foreign minister Franco Frattini confirmed that Rome was in discreet contact with a number of countries over the possibility of Gaddafi going into exile overseas I hope there will be a certain number of states ready to host him  maybe under the auspices of the African Union which can have leverage over them he said He categorically ruled out Italy offering Gaddafi a bolthole Mr Camerons official spokesman said We have got a clear view which is that he should go We also think people should be held accountable for their actions We are not engaged in looking for somewhere for him to go but that doesnt exclude others doing so Our priority is that he should go as soon as possible I dont think exile necessarily precludes someone being held accountable by the ICC Mr Hague asked last night about the possibility of exile said That is up to him There is no doubt that if Colonel Gaddafi left power  wherever he went  there would be a major change in the situation and that is what most of the world and probably most of the Libyan people want to see '

aS'Ethiopia Group claiming to be Jewish clashes with police\nAbout 80 people injured 80 arrested in demonstrations outside Israeli Embassy in Addis Ababa as group demands right to immigrate to Israel The complicated issue of Ethiopian Jewish heritage and eligibility for aliya came to the fore again on Wednesday morning as thousands of demonstrators clashed with police outside the Israeli Embassy in Addis Ababa local media there reported I can confirm that about 80 people were injured in the demonstrations four were taken to hospital and all but one person who is serious condition has been sent home Asher Seyum the Jewish Agency for Israel representative in Ethiopia told The Jerusalem Post While the majority of reports from the scene described the demonstrators as Ethiopian Jews and said they were demanding that the Israeli Government consider their applications to travel to their homeland to rejoin their families Seyum and other Ethiopian Jewish sources denied that this community is actually Jewish They live illegally in a former Jewish Agency compound near the Israeli Embassy and they claim that they have Jewish roots explained Seyum adding most of them have been checked for eligibility by the State of Israel and most of them have been turned down for aliya but they refuse to give up In an interview in the Africa Review one young demonstrator described how police had tore up an Israeli flag and desecrated our synagogue Even though this specific group does not fit the criteria to make aliya under guidelines originally laid out by the Israeli government in 2003 and approved again last November it still chooses to follow Jewish tradition and religious practices Many of the men wear kippot and the group prays daily in a makeshift synagogue According to Ethiopian Knesset Member Shlomo Molla a vocal advocate for continuing eligibility checks for one specific group of Ethiopians that claims Jewish ancestry referred to as Falash Mura the Israeli government working with the Jewish Agency closed its compound in Addis Ababa six years ago after completing background checks of some 10000 Falash Mura Roughly 2000 people did not meet the criteria and were turned down for aliya he explained adding that among the community in Gondar a further 3000 were also not approved to immigrate to Israel Both Molla and Seyum said they believed that those are the people who often protest outside the Israeli embassy for the right to move to Israel The problem is that if you widen the criteria then there will be no end to the aliya from Ethiopia said Seyum adding I have worked out that from one person who is accepted for aliya you could trace another 60 people who might be able to argue that they have the right to come too The issue of Ethiopian Jewish aliya has become particularly controversial in recent years with the government backtracking regularly on its position regarding the Falash Mura Jews There have also been fierce debates among the Ethiopian community in Israel over who should be allowed to move to the Jewish state and who should not Four years ago the government announced plans to wind up its aliya operation in Ethiopia and by the start of 2008 the Interior Ministry had recalled its Gondarbased staff However subsequent protests from local community members representatives of North American Jewry and several key Israeli legislators insisted that up to 9000 Falash Mura still needed to be assed for immigration according to a 2003 resolution that was based on a national census  the Efrati list  compiled by then Interior Ministry Director General David Efrati in 1999 To be eligible aliya applicants must appear on this list have relatives to sponsor them living in Israel and be able to trace their maternal lineage back seven years to Jewish roots In September 2009 the Interior Ministry announced that its representatives would be returning to Ethiopia to continue eligibility checks but less than a year later the matter came under doubt again when the treasury claimed the process was too costly Further pressure from the proFalash Mura lobby soon reversed this decision and last November the cabinet finally gave approval for eligibility checks to be carried out on 8700 people with a view to ending the organized aliya for good At the core of the debate over this complicated African immigration story is the governments willingness to recognize the 1999 Efrati list which originally included three volumes Falash Mura living in Addis Ababa those in Gondar and others from outlying villages Interior Ministry officials at the time decided to focus only on those from the two cities ignoring the list from the villages However as people left the cities more Falash Mura Jews arrived from the villages and those are the people who today are waiting in Gondar to immigrate to Israel It is important to wrap up this issue as fast as possible MK Molla said Wednesday The longer we wait the larger these groups claiming Jewish heritage will grow and then this story will never end Jewish Agency spokesman Haviv Rettig Gur told The Post that even though organized aliya from Ethiopia will soon be over Any Jew and any aliya eligible person can make aliya including from Ethiopia What is changing is that the special aliya track that goes beyond the regular aliya absorption package is ending he said adding If Jews remain in Ethiopia theyll still be able to make aliya Those deemed ineligible for either track are not eligible for aliya Gil Shefler contributed to this report '

aS'Vegetarians may be at lower diabetes heart risk\nBy Kerry Grens NEW YORK Reuters Health  A new study finds that a meatfree diet seems to lower a persons likelihood of having certain risk factors for diabetes or heart disease  and therefore may lower the risk of one day developing those illnesses Researchers measured a suite of factors  blood sugar blood fats blood pressure waist size and body mass  that when elevated add up to metabolic syndrome and found that vegetarians were lower than nonvegetarians on all counts except cholesterol Having metabolic syndrome puts people at a greater risk of developing diabetes or heart disease in the future In the study 23 out of every 100 vegetarians were found to have at least three metabolic syndrome factors compared with thirtynine out of every 100 nonvegetarians and 37 out of every 100 semivegetarians I was expecting there should be a difference said Nico Rizzo of Loma Linda University the lead researcher on the study But I didnt expect that it would be that much Rizzo and his colleagues analyzed the diet health and lifestyles of more than 700 adults Using questionnaires on eating habits the researchers categorized participants as vegetarians eating meat of any kind less than once a month semivegetarians eating meat or poultry less than once a week and nonvegetarians The researchers also measured sugar fat and cholesterol in the subjects blood as well as blood pressure waist size and body mass index BMI  a measurement of a persons weight relative to height Vegetarians average BMI of 257 was four points lower than that of nonvegetarians who on average had BMIs close to 30 A BMI greater than 25 is considered overweight and greater than 30 is considered obese Semivegetarians fell in the middle with a BMI and waist size smaller than nonvegetarians but larger than vegetarians The pattern held when the measurements were combined to determine the presence of metabolic syndrome Rizzo told Reuters Health he is not sure whats behind the differences Is it primarily the meat intake the plant food intake or a combination of both Rizzo said Its also possible that diet is not the cause the research showed only an association between food choices and health factors not causeandeffect High BMI for instance one of the traits that make up the metabolic syndrome profile itself contributes to high blood pressure and indirectly blood sugar and thereby potentially raising a persons risk of heart disease and diabetes The current study published in the journal Diabetes Care also did not follow the subjects over the long term to see whether those who abstained from meat actually had lower rates of diabetes or heart disease The data for this research which was funded by the National Institutes of Health came from the Adventist Health Study 2 a long term study of Seventh Day Adventists This religious group has considerably more vegetarians than the general population In this study 35 percent of the subjects did not eat meat whereas only about five percent of all Americans are vegetarian One of the differences Rizzo discovered between the groups was age Vegetarians on average were 3 years older than the meateaters Even though theyre older theyre in better shape Rizzo said Thats something I found quite interesting SOURCE bitlygoHGBG Diabetes Care online March 16 2011 '

aS'Bashar Assad appoints Adel Safar new PM of Syria\nSYRIAN President Bashar Assad last night asked former agriculture minister Adel Safar to form a new government as communications networks failed and residents in Douma prepared to bury the first of their dead Mr Safars appointment came after Mr Assad fired his cabinet in a bid to quell prodemocracy protests but dashed hopes he would lift almost 50 years of emergency rule in a rare address Mobile phone and internet networks failed yesterday in Syria due to an overload according to a customer representative a day after authorities had carried out a wave of arrests in protest cities after nine people were killed in protests for reform the day before There is an arrest campaign and phone lines are down so people suspect interference but the government says it is a technical problem said a resident of Douma north of Damascus The wave of raids targeted the southern town of Daraa one of the centres of more than two weeks of demonstrations as well as Douma and the industrial city of Homs In a joint statement eight human rights groups said 46 people had been arrested four people had died and dozens had been wounded in the crackdown A Douma resident said the agricultural town was calm despite security forces withholding some bodies from the previous days deadly violence in an apparent bid to prevent funerals from sparking fresh protests Witnesses said security forces had used live ammunition to disperse stonethrowing protesters after Friday prayers Authorities denied the security forces were responsible for the deaths blaming them on an armed group that fired from rooftops Yusef Abu Rumiyeh a member of parliament for Daraa denounced security forces for opening fire on his constituents without pity and preventing the wounded from getting to hospital The people of Hauran were waiting for President Bashar Assad to visit to offer his condolences Had he done so nothing that happened subsequently would have taken place he said in a video posted on YouTube Friday of Martyrs protests were also staged in the port of Latakia Darriya near the capital and the northeastern Kurdish towns of Qamishli and Amuda Washington slammed the use of force and applauded the courage and dignity of demonstrators But analysts said US President Barack Obama was not ready to throw his support behind the opposition They are afraid that Mr Assad will not go gently into that good night and therefore they might try to create trouble and that will create a civil wartype scenario said Ammar Abdulhamid a Washingtonbased Syrian dissident and democracy activist They fear it will be either civil war or they will have to deal with an even more radicalised and antiWestern regime if the Assads came up in control again he said In Yemen police fired teargas and live bullets at protesters holding an antiregime demonstration in the city of Taez yesterday killing one and wounding dozens In the southern city of Aden protesters hurled stones at riot police backed by tanks and duelling rallies were held in the capital Sanaa With the US heavily invested in Yemens fight against alQaida Defence Secretary Robert Gates said a week ago the fall of Ali Abdullah Salehs regime could pose a real problem for the US AFP AP '

aS'Are Some Kids Overscheduled\nExperts debate pros cons of highly programmed childhood THURSDAY March 31 HealthDay News  From sports practices to music lessons to community service American kids always seem to have plenty to keep them busy But whether theyre actually too busy  reaching a tipping point detrimental to their mental and physical health  remains a topic of debate The subject of overscheduled children has been on scientists radar for at least a decade said Andrea Mata a doctoral student at Kent State University whose recent study on highly involved children was scheduled for presentation Thursday at a symposium in Montreal run by the Society for Research in Child Development I think its a hot topic right now Mata said Theres definitely a mix of viewpoints So I think a lot more research is needed to find out whats going on The SRCD symposium will examine which children and adolescents become overscheduled what happens at high levels of extracurricular involvement and how factors such as school grades and aggression levels are affected Between 70 percent and 83 percent of American children and teens claim to take part in at least one extracurricular pursuit spending an average of five to nine hours per week in structured activities according to the SRCD Only 5 percent to 7 percent however devote more than 20 hours per week to these activities Jean Twenge author of the book Generation Me and a professor of psychology at San Diego State University said data gathered between the 1950s and the 1990s indicated overscheduling rose during that period and then leveled off Are kids really overscheduled Its not the average experience but that doesnt mean its not a problem Twenge said Parents worry about keeping up but its certain types of parents who worry about it Twenge said the evermounting competition for admission to the nations top colleges compels some parents and kids to fill every spare hour with impressivelooking endeavors Matas study followed 1354 children from birth through age 15 dividing them into groups based on how involved they were outside of school and home The 43 children in the highest activity level averaged 129 minutes per week of structured activities at kindergarten which increased to 254 minutes weekly by fifth grade Highly involved children were more likely to be girls from more affluent families Mata said and their mothers had attained higher education levels This group had higher grades and lower levels of delinquency among other behavioral and academic measurements compared to lessinvolved children she said Were looking at it in a much more positive way Mata said These highly involved kids are highly adaptive and highfunctioning Linda Balog former executive director of the Child and Adolescent Stress Management Institute at State University of New York at Brockport said parents should ask their children how they feel about their extracurricular pursuits and whether they feel overwhelmed and stressed We see some kids forced into organized sports at early ages and then get so burned out that they opt not to play in high school said Balog an associate professor of health sciences whos teaching a course on child and adolescent stress Sometimes parents live through their children  a sort of surrogate self she added I think we have to err on the side of backing off a bit    as opposed to everything being organized and structured Experts note that research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until it is published in a peerreviewed journal '

aS'New Device Uses Carbon Nanotubes to Catch Tumor Cells Quickly\nCould eventually allow doctors to see if cancer has spread from its original site faster than ever Harvard and MIT researchers have developed a tool that is capable of identifying single cancer cells within a blood sample Mehmet Toner study leader and a professor of biomedical engineering at Harvard Medical School and Brian Wardle an MIT associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics have created an instrument that could eventually allow doctors to see if cancer has spread from its original site faster than ever Circulating tumor cells which are cancer cells that escaped from the original tumor can be difficult to find because a 1milliliter sample of blood which has tens of billions of normal blood cells only contains several circulating tumor cells Of all deaths from cancer 90 percent are not the result of cancer at the primary site said Wardle Theyre from tumors that spread from the original site In response to this dilemma Toner created a new microfluidic device capable of detecting these circulating tumor cells He originally designed the device four years ago and it worked by allowing a patients blood sample to travel past tens of thousands of little silicon posts that are covered with antibodies These antibodies stick to tumor cells and any cancer cells that touch the silicon posts are caught and held in place The problem with this prototype was that certain cells might never come in contact with the silicon posts at all Toner has since made changes to the device with the help of Wardle making it eight times better than the original The microfluidic device now features porous posts instead of those that are solid which were made using carbon nanotubes The carbon nanotubes are small hollow cylinders that have walls made of carbon atom lattices A forest of these nanotubes have 10 billion to 100 billion carbon nanotubes per square centimeter and are 99 percent air and less than 1 percent carbon Much like the original version these carbon nanotubes are coated with antibodies that capture particular cancer cells The device is also customizable allowing researchers to attach different antibodies to the carbon nanotubes or adjusting the space between the nanotubes in order to catch objects of different sizes from circulating tumor cells to viruses The porous posts allow cells to run through them much like a filter offering greater chance of catching the cells researchers are looking for Toner and Wardles device is currently being tested in hospitals and is expected to be made available commercially within the next few years In addition researchers hope to adjust the device for HIV diagnosis as well This study was published in Small  '

aS'Has Emissions Cap and Trade Created Toxic Hotspots A New Study Says No\nDespite concerns that date back to the early days of emissions trading a US EPA program that lets coalfired power plants buy and sell the right to pollute hasnt hit poor people and minorities with dirtier air than everyone else according to a new study pdf Long before greens rallied around cap and trade as their preferred way to slow global warming many of them raised doubts about Congress plan to let companies swap allowances for the emissions that form acid rain Environmental justice advocates worried that the free market could lead to toxic hotspots cutting pollution overall but concentrating the rest of it in vulnerable areas Over the first 15 years of US EPAs Acid Rain Program the opposite has occurred says Evan Ringquist a professor at Indiana Universitys School of Public and Environmental Affairs Past research shows that poor people and minorities are more likely to live in places with dirty air But under the trading program industrial plants in those neighborhoods bought fewer licenses to pollute according to Ringquists new study which will appear in the upcoming issue of Social Science Quarterly  Marketbased programs have generally been more efficient than commandandcontrol rules and the new study adds to the evidence that those savings do not come at the cost of greater inequality Ringquist said In general the research shows that most of the early fears havent come to pass he told Greenwire  Emissions that lead to acid rain have fallen across the board since EPA started trading programs for sulfur dioxide SO2 and nitrogen oxides NOx under the Clean Air Act Data released by the agency last week show that the coal plants in the programs released 511 million tons of SO2 and 205 million tons of NOx last year  down 675 percent and 692 percent respectively from 1990 levels Both types of pollution are also linked to health problems When released into the air SO2 forms fine soot that is linked to breathing problems heart attacks and death while NOx is one of the chemicals that typically causes smog problems in urban areas Since trading began some critics have predicted that minority neighborhoods would see fewer health benefits today because nearby companies would buy pollution credits rather than add equipment to control their emissions In a 1999 article several legal scholars decried Southern Californias trading program for SO2 and NOx as a failed experiment for that reason Pollution trading in Los Angeles has led to concentrated toxic air emission hotspots that have shackled lowincome and minority communities with the regions air pollution they wrote in the Duke Environmental Law and Policy Forum But the new study says the nationwide trading program may have narrowed the pollution gap between whites and minorities especially Latinos It adds to the findings of groups such as the Environmental Law Institute Environmental Defense Fund and Resources for the Future all of which looked at the trading program about a decade ago and concluded it was not causing hotspots Based on an empirical analysis of all swaps that took place between January 1995 and March 2009 Ringquist found that for every 10 percent increase in the percentage of Hispanic households in a certain ZIP code there was a 41 percent decrease in the chance that a nearby facility would buy more SO2 allowances than it sold If the proportion of black households within a mile of an industrial plant increased by 10 percent the facility was 08 percent less likely to be an importer of pollution credits If there is an equity effect from allowance trading in this model it works to the advantage of communities of color the study says Still a trading program does not require the air to be equally clean in all areas Industrial plants bought more credits than they sold in places where large percentages of people did not finish high school Ringquist found Surprisingly the same was true in areas where homeowners  rather than renters  made up a larger share of the population Wider implications Though the acid rain program has been widely touted as a success and embraced by most environmental groups concerns about toxic  and discriminatory  hotspots have lingered as policymakers have debated ways to cut pollution The fear of hotspots was often raised by critics as the George W Bush administration tried to take a marketbased approach to mercury emissions from coalfired power plants In 2005 before the Clean Air Mercury Rule was thrown out in federal court EPAs inspector general released a report saying that the agency had not done enough to ensure that the emissions trading plan would not lead to mercury hotspots  EENews PM  May 5 2005 And while there is no worry about local emissions of carbon dioxide because it isnt toxic the idea that trading programs will lead to hotspots has regardless been raised as governments have tried to limit the greenhouse gases that are linked to climate change When the state of Californias capandtrade program for carbon dioxide was stalled in court last week it was because of a challenge from local activists who say the trading program will have the side effect of exposing their neighborhoods to other types of toxic pollution San Francisco County Superior Court Judge Ernest Goldsmith ruled that the Air Resources Board had not given enough attention to the idea of putting a tax on every ton of carbon released into the air Neither option would guarantee cleaner air in Wilmington Calif a city with three refineries nearby and a population that is about 87 percent Latino said Jesse Marquez executive director of Coalition for a Safe Environment Even if you put in a tax a tax still allows refiners to continue polluting Marquez said Theyll just spend millions to offset their pollution The only way to offset refiner pollution is to eliminate refiner pollution  Greenwire  March 24 If the new analysis of the acid rain programs are any indication there isnt necessarily a tension between efficiency and fairness said Michael Livermore a law professor at New York University and executive director of the schools Institute for Policy Integrity That is promising for marketbased efforts but it is not a guarantee that future capandtrade systems will turn out the same way he said We dont need to trust in our luck Livermore said We can design our programs to reduce the risk of hotspots Click here pdf to read the study Copyright 2011 EE Publishing All Rights Reserved For more news on energy and the

aS'South Poles First Building Blown Up After 53 Years\nOnly a select few ever make it to the South Pole Still fewer get to blow things up there And only one man has the distinction of blowing up a piece of real estate at the South Pole that he once called home It was a little sad but the day goes on said John Rand a consulting engineer with the US Armys Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory CRREL Last December the Antarctic Sun recently reported Rand was part of a crew charged with dynamiting a piece of history  the very first permanent dwelling ever built at the South Pole Related Extreme Living Scientists at the End of the Earth In the decades since it was constructed in the mid 1950s the longabandoned outpost was swallowed up by the evershifting snows of the frozen continent And after a frightening accident the original South Pole station had to go Rand a specialist in drilling ice cores  long cylinders of ice pulled up from glaciers  passed his first South Pole stay at the station a fourmonth exercise in long hours isolation and bachelor living from late 1971 to early 1972 Even then the station was 15 or 20 feet 45 or 6 meters below the surface Chambers called top hats  giant boxes with roughly the same dimensions as the stations identical buildings  had been stacked atop the structures to keep their roofs above the snow which tends to compact and thus sink under a building while snow blows in and piles up around it In essence the terrain is rising said George L Blaisdell operations manager for the National Science Foundations US Antarctic Program who explained that the physics at work at the South Pole makes building there difficult The elevation at the South Pole hasnt changed in the last 50 years Blaisdell told OurAmazingPlanet but if you put something on the surface and came back a year later it would be further down in the snowpack Thats precisely what happened to the old South Pole station By the time Rand helped blow the station up in December it was 30 feet 9 meters below the surface However the longabandoned station once played a pivotal role in scientific and world history First in never out The original station was a nofrills military affair  essentially a series of glorified boxes made from sturdy wooden beams and plywood The research base was built by the Seabees the Navys construction unit building on the structure began in late 1956 and the station was dedicated in January 1957 The project stemmed from the International Geophysical Year IGY an 18month period of coordinated scientific endeavor from July 1957 to December 1958 when countries including the United States the then Soviet Union and several European nations sent thousands of researchers out into the wild and littleexplored regions of the planet to push the boundaries of Earth science The Americans christened the base the AmundsenScott IGY South Pole Station to honor the only other humans to ever set foot at the Pole ahead of the seminal construction People had first and last been to the Pole nearly five decades earlier in 1911 during the famed race that pitted Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen against doomed Englishman Robert Falcon Scott Amundsen won the race and Scott died on the return journey from the pole Related In Images  Race for the South Pole At the conclusion of the IGY when the time came to pack up and go home the Americans decided to stay put in their little station at 90 degrees south latitude Not only was great science happening at the South Pole but a permanent US station at the literal convergence of the planets longitude lines had enormous strategic value The US felt that by being at the geographic South Pole we would have something of a claim if you will Blaisdell said and having been there longer than anyone else be able to put pressure on other people trying to divvy up Antarctica The Americans extended stay in Antarctica and at the Pole was one of several geopolitical circumstances that paved the way for the Antarctic Treaty signed in 1959  the worlds first nuclear arms agreement and a milestone international decision to leave the frozen continent free of territorial claims by any country The treaty is still in force today Danger zone The original AmundsenScott station was largely abandoned in 1974 for a newer station nearby constructed under a dome That station in turn was recently abandoned for a brand new AmundsenScott facility dedicated in 2008  a gleaming construction perched atop 36 stilts that can be ratcheted higher when the snow begins to encroach Rand said the original station invisible beneath the snow was marked out on the surface by flags that covered an area about 150 by 300 to 400 feet 45 by 90 to 120 meters To prepare to demolish the station Rand and his colleagues drilled a warren of holes down to the topmost level of the buried station and threaded dynamite down into the snow Over the course of three days in early December the charges were detonated collapsing the roof of the station and creating a large crater in the snow Rand said it was with mixed emotions that he watched the explosions shoot snow high into the air It was truly the end of that station The year before it was intact and now its put to bed Rand said However he said it had to be done The area was dangerous A year earlier despite the visible network of flags marking the perimeter of the site a giant tractor somehow ended up atop the former station The snow collapsed beneath the weight of the massive machine which crashed through the top roof of the old station The driver wasnt hurt but ended up at the bottom of a 30foot 9m hole He was quickly retrieved by crews on harnesses but getting the tractor out proved to be tricky The accident was a wakeup call according to Blaisdell and Rand and the wheels were put in motion to remove the danger Video Link httpwwwyoutubenocookiecomvU0d3vjt4Gkfs1hlenUSrel0 A year before a friend almost got hurt badly and we needed to solve that problem Rand said And thats what we did The giant crater that remains where the station once stood has already begun to fill up with snow and Blaisdell said the area would be safe for new construction soon perhaps as early as 2013 With its high altitude dry conditions and extreme vantage point the South Pole offers some of the best observing conditions on Earth and the newly openedup real estate is highly coveted among scientists brimming with ideas Its just a matter of deciding which ones have the best possible payoff Blaisdell said  North vs South Poles 10 Wild

aS'Specialists say stats on selfinjury are alarming\nShe couldnt cope More than that she couldnt feel The teenage girl was a victim of incest and all that she endured all the emotional damage that she carried she buried She just had bottled up her emotions all this pain She just couldnt feel anymore said Jeff Johnston a psychotherapist with Cape Girardeaubased Associated Counseling Services By the time the teen came to Johnston she had been in and out of home placement removed from her family By the time she came to Johnston she had discovered a dangerous relief The girl was a cutter tearing her flesh with a paper clip or a razor blade to achieve a kind of curious release a bloody catharsis She resorted to hurting herself so she could feel something he said Johnston has worked in counseling services for nearly a quartercentury and this cutter was the worst case of selfinjurious behavior he said hes seen He said he has seen more clients battling selfinjury in recent years most of them young more female than male He sees them as young as middle school and the incidents of cutting tend to get worse as they get older While there are conflicting statistics on prevalence there are signs that selfinjury or selfmutilation as it also is called is on the rise according to research analysis from Cornell University and the University of Rochester Guidance counselors and mental health specialists in Southeast Missouri say the numbers arent epidemic but that the incidents are alarming In her first few years as a counselor at Perry County Middle School Barb Macke learned of a group of boys who were cutting themselves She had never heard of such behavior and it was terrifying Macke did some research and found behavioral science theories suggesting cutting might be an indicator of suicidal thoughts The boys were recommended for counseling and the four friends didnt appear to have any subsequent problems It seemed more of a machismo thing young teens trying to show how tough they were For several years Macke said cutting seemed to disappear from the list of adolescent problems It has resurfaced she said This year she has worked with the parents of a sixthgrader who was cutting himself with the wire from his looseleaf notebook She has seen others who have cut deeper most for similar reasons When confronted some have claimed their marks and scars are cat scratches These are very uniform almost parallel marks obviously not a cat scratch the counselor said After seeing a half a dozen cutters last school year Macke said she knows of only a couple of confirmed cases at the middle school this year The numbers are difficult to track there are few comprehensive studies on selfinjury and the research often is contradictory Broad estimates indicate about 1 percent of the total US population perhaps as many as 3 million Americans show signs of selfinjurious behavior Another study in the Journal of Clinical Psychology reported rates of 4 percent A 2004 British study Young People and SelfHarm estimates 10 percent of people ages 11 to 25 selfinjure Research suggests females are only somewhat more likely to selfinjure than males according to the New York universities fact sheet While it may seem paradoxical cutters see selfinjury as a coping mechanism  an unhealthy coping mechanism Johnston said but a way to relieve stress anxiety frustration fear nonetheless It appears these kids have a lot of internalized emotions they havent coped with and they are looking to express the pain he said Its often about control mental health care professionals say Cutters often feel like hurting themselves is one of the few actions over which they have control Some seek to purify themselves or to reenact a trauma Cutters come from all backgrounds Ruth Ward social worker for the Jackson School District said she has seen the stereotypical good student struggling with cutting issues What most have in common she said is they are looking for something I think it can be a cry for help Ward said I think a lot of times if a person is a true cutter they are doing it to get a sense of relief from the anxiety or the builtup emotions Johnston said some kind of dysfunction  abuse divorce a bitter custody battle  is a common thread among selfabusers Cutting research suggests can become addictive As painful as it may seem to carve or mutilate the skin cutters come to depend on the release of endorphins clinical experts say The progression to sharper instruments and deeper cuts becomes part of the demanding high The process can be likened to that of a growing drug addiction where at first small amounts provide a sense of calm and wellbeing says the SelfInjury Fact Sheet from the New York universities As tolerance builds the user needs increasing amounts to achieve the same effect I had a student who had scarred her body Ward said The teen received psychiatric help she said and appears to be doing better While there is debate in the psychiatric community Johnston said selfinjury appears to decrease suicidal thoughts and action For most it serves as a temporary release he said Though he said he hates to use the word in the context of cutting Johnston sees some selfinjury among teens almost as a fad Some kids even identify around it like its cool to be a cutter he said Thats always a scary thing when you see a child falling into that category where they feel affirmed because they are a cutter Ward said Jackson Middle School dealt with a copycat situation a couple of years ago when a true cutter experiencing emotional problems was imitated by friends On another occasion a number of students tried cutting after reading a book detailing a young persons struggle with selfmutilation They used the book as a manual to injure themselves It was very scary Ward said We had to address that with the whole group of students involved Johnston believes cutters like alcoholics are always in a state of recovery The tendency is always there Johnston employs cognitive behavior therapy helping clients recognize emotional triggers and correcting distorted forms of thinking For many teens particularly girls he said journaling is an effective and positive form of coping And he encourages selfabusers to openly express their emotions with safe people in their lives It is important to substitute a more positive coping strategy and not just eliminate the selfinjury according to the SelfInjury Fact Sheet Cutters will sometimes replace selfinjury with other selfdestructive behaviors such as drug abuse Antidepressants also have been found to reduce some of the urge to selfinjure the fact sheet says Ultimately there must be recognition Johnston said They have to realize this is an unhealthy behavior

aS'Ripples in Saturn and Jupiter rings caused by comet crashes\nRipples in Saturns rings date back to 1983 Jupiters rings were disrupted in 1994 Scientists have traced ripples in the ring systems of Saturn and Jupiter back to collisions with comets more than ten years ago The ripples detected in Saturns rings date back to 1983 while the disruption to Jupiters lesserknown rings was caused in 1994 Nasa researchers believe The culprit in the case of Jupiter was comet ShoemakerLevy 9 whose debris cloud hurtled through the planets thin ring system during a kamikaze course into the planet in July 1994 Scroll down for video Saturns ripples were caused by a similar object  likely another cloud of comet debris  plunging through the inner rings in the second half of 1983 Lead author Dr Matthew Hedman from Cornell University New York said Whats cool is were finding evidence that a planets rings can be affected by specific traceable events that happened in the last 30 years rather than a hundred million years ago The solar system is a much more dynamic place than we gave it credit for From Nasa orbiter Galileos visit to Jupiter scientists have known since the late 1990s about patchy patterns in the Jovian ring But the Galileo images were fuzzy and so didnt explain why such patterns would occur The trail was cold until Cassini entered orbit around Saturn in 2004 and started sending back thousands of images A 2007 paper by Dr Hedman and colleagues first noted corrugations in Saturns innermost ring dubbed the D ring A group including Dr Hedman and Dr Mark Showalter from the SETI Institute in Mountain View California then realised that the grooves in the D ring appeared to wind together more tightly over time Playing the process backward Dr Hedman then demonstrated the pattern originated when something tilted the D ring off its axis by about 100metres in late 1983 The scientists found the influence of Saturns gravity on the tilted area warped the ring into a tightening spiral Cassini imaging scientists got another clue when the sun shone directly along Saturns equator and lit the rings edgeon in August 2009 The unique lighting conditions highlighted ripples not previously seen in another part of the ring system Whatever happened in 1983 was not a small localised event  it was big The collision had tilted a region more than 12000miles wide covering part of the D ring and the next outermost ring called the C ring Unfortunately spacecraft were not visiting Saturn at that time and the planet was on the far side of the sun hidden from telescopes on or orbiting Earth so whatever happened in 1983 passed unnoticed by astronomers Dr Hedman and Dr Showalter began to wonder whether the longforgotten pattern in Jupiters ring system might illuminate the mystery Using Galileo images from 1996 and 2000 Dr Showalter confirmed a similar winding spiral pattern They applied the same maths they had applied to Saturn  but now with Jupiters gravitational influence factored in Unwinding the spiral pinpointed the date when Jupiters ring was tilted off its axis to between June and September 1994 ShoemakerLevy plunged into the Jovian atmosphere during late July 1994 The estimated size of the nucleus was also consistent with the amount of material needed to disturb Jupiters ring The Galileo images also revealed a second spiral which was calculated to have originated in 1990 Images taken by New Horizons in 2007 when the spacecraft flew by Jupiter on its way to Pluto showed two newer ripple patterns in addition to the fading echo of the ShoemakerLevy impact We now know that collisions into the rings are very common  a few times per decade for Jupiter and a few times per century for Saturn Dr Showalter said Now scientists know that the rings record these impacts like grooves in a vinyl record and we can play back their history later The ripples also give scientists clues to the size of the clouds of cometary debris that hit the rings In each of these cases the nuclei of the comets  before they likely broke apart  were a few kilometres wide The findings are detailed in a pair of papers published online today in the journal Science '

aS'Half a Million Die From Smoking Yearly in US\nSmoking causes half a million deaths each year in the US killing slightly more men than women new statistics show The rates of smokingrelated deaths in men were comparable to whats been found in other recent analyses The numbers for the women however were higher than expected The study published in the journal Epidemiology is an important reminder that this huge epidemicneeds ongoing measurement said Dr Prabhat Jha who studies smoking mortality and heads the Center for Global Health Research at St Michaels Hospital in Toronto We just cant assume that we know enough about where this epidemic is going Jha who was not involved in the current study told Reuters Health For the new report Dr Brian Rostron then of the University of California Berkeley used data from a national health survey that asked nearly 250000 people if and how much they smoked currently and in the past Participants were tracked for 2 to 9 years after filling out the survey By the time the study ended in 2006 about 17000 of them had died Rostron who now works at the Food and Drug Administration calculated the odds of dying for smokers and nonsmokers of different ages and genders Then he applied the extra risks due to smoking to the total US population According to his calculations there were an average of about 290000 smokingrelated deaths in men each year between 2002 and 2006 and 230000 in women  a total of over half a million deaths In all about 25 million people in the US die every year according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Among all current and former smokers the greatest increase in risk of a tobaccorelated death was seen between the ages of 65 and 74 Once other factors such as weight and alcohol consumption were taken into account people in that age group were three times as likely to die from any cause if they currently smoked between one and two packs of cigarettes a day compared to if they had never smoked As evidence of the risks of smoking has accumulated and spread the number of current smokers in the US has dropped over the past few decades A new study in The Journal of the American Medical Association confirms that trend about 7 percent of adults in the US were heavy smokers in 2007 compared to 23 percent in 1965 The researchers on that study led by Dr John Pierce of the University of California San Diego defined heavy smoking as 20 or more cigarettes a day Despite that good news Jha said the new estimates show the need for more information on how smoking affects women It might well be that in women the effects are greater and more severe but we need more evidence he said Jha added that while rates of smoking and deaths from smoking have been falling over the long term in the US theyve been rising in lowincome countries Because of that overall the number of smokingrelated deaths worldwide is bound to increase Jha said Currently there are about 5 to 6 million smokingrelated deaths each year worldwide he said '

aS'Do AtHome Genetic Tests Tell Too Much and Explain Too Little\nExperts say field is in its infancy and consumers should seek professional opinions on results FRIDAY April 1 HealthDay News  Athome pregnancy tests can tell you unequivocally in minutes whether a baby is on the way and if it is time to call your doctor But athome genetic tests  which may offer tantalizing clues about future health risks  are still in their infancy and genetic counselors are concerned that the results may puzzle or even panic consumers who dont seek professional guidance The explosion of directtoconsumer genetic tests over the past several years has made it seemingly simple to test for a wide variety of medical scenarios A swab of the cheek or a vial of blood can discern whether one is a carrier of an inherited disorder such as cystic fibrosis for instance or predict the risk for diseases such as breast cancer or Parkinsons Newer tests purportedly predict how people might respond to a specific drug or medical treatment But shelling out several hundred dollars or more for one of these tests  which are widely available online  does not equip consumers to understand the findings or their repercussions genetic counselors say Because people might base medical decisions on the results the US Food and Drug Administration decided this month to restrict the tests on a casebycase basis To me its still very much in the recreational realm said Caroline Lieber a genetic counselor and director of the graduate program in human genetics at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers NY The concern I have is the majority of the people feel knowledge is power whereas most havent thought through the implications at all The US Human Genome Project begun 21 years ago to map out which genes are responsible for both physical and functional traits led to unprecedented knowledge about how genes affect peoples propensity for dozens of traits and conditions But few predicted at the outset the complications that capitalism might create A recent undercover study of 15 directtoconsumer tests by the US Government Accountability Office found egregious examples of deceptive marketing in addition to poor or nonexistent advice from supposed consultation experts according to a recent report in The Lancet  The bottom line Lieber said is that an increasing number of companies bottom lines are impacted by peoples desires to live longer healthier lives My sense right now is its very much about those companies making money said Lieber whose human genetics masters program at Sarah Lawrence is the nations first and largest The cynic in me says theyre doing it mostly to make money but I do think thats changing Now phone counseling is being offered and its better than not having anything Whether conducted by phone Internet or in person such counseling  if done by qualified experts  can help translate hard science into information that the average consumer can understand For example if a genetic test shows a low risk of diabetes that doesnt mean that diet exercise and other healthy lifestyle measures arent necessary said Dr Robb Rowley an internal medicine physician at Amigenics a Las Vegasbased genetic testing and counseling group At this point I still recommend genetic testing be done through a healthcare provider said Rowley whose patients mostly consult on their predisposition to cancer Some have dire consequences    and without having a physician involved people might do something to change their lives that they wouldnt otherwise do Lieber said she thinks most who order athome tests are unaware counseling exists to help them interpret the results Others she suspects dont want the scrutiny of outsiders knowing their personal medical history Probably my biggest concern is to have them understand genetic counselors are not there to tell people what to do I think thats a misperception about the field she said But if the results make them view themselves not as a person but as a carrier for something  if they havent thought about it  it can truly be damaging Rowley said the ultimate scenario which he predicts is five to 10 years out is to be able to use each individuals unique DNA to optimize their care The goal in the future is to be able to take that individual and say Dont worry about osteoporosis lets focus on your cardiovascular health and by the way this medication has a 40 percent chance of working for you Rowley said To a limited extent were there now '

aS'After Final Four berths can we still call Butler VCU Cinderellas\nCNN  Cinderella Its a simple enough metaphor for college basketball right Cinderella is a commoner the story goes abused and ridiculed by her stepmom and stepsisters on the eve of the royal ball If not for the unlikely confluence of magic and mice she has no hope of meeting Prince Charming In the world of college hoops you can supplant wicked stepmom with media evil stepsisters with perennial basketball powerhouses royal ball with NCAA tournament and Prince Charming with winning the whole shebang If were pushing the metaphor you can also replace mice and magic with suffocating defense and lightsout 3point shooting But when is the metaphor misplaced Ever Can a team shake the consummate underdog label How With Butler and Virginia Commonwealth  neither a stranger to toppling bigs  on tap this weekend I began researching the Cinderellas origin I learned the story dates to ninthcentury China and the term appears to have been popularized in Caddyshack when groundskeeper Carl Spackler aptly played by Bill Murray dreams of one day playing in the Masters Butler returns to home crowd Vasectomy during March Madness Basketball dribbler aims for record After an hour of suffering the internets woefully unhelpful answers I picked up the phone and called Michael Litos a marketing consultant and freelance sportswriter but more importantly the author of Cinderella The Rise of the MidMajor Litos told me he doesnt like the term Cinderella or the term midmajor  used to describe teams not aligned with one of the major conferences  but he realizes why we need them By we he means the media I can see the metaphor and Im fine with it he said The media need them to kind of put things into boxes  What I hope we get past is people being surprised when midmajor teams win ballgames I took no offense because  well hes right With Vegas estimating that 100 million people filled out brackets this year wagering a collective 3 billion on legal and illegal soothsaying the media are guaranteed a captive audience At least until VCU or Butler came along and decimated the countrys brackets Read SIcoms complete tourney coverage Before going back to Litos let me offer a disclaimer Litos is a Ram a VCU alumnus He remembers when his boys toppled Duke in the 2007 tourney He cringed when ESPNs Hubert Davis said VCU didnt belong in this years showdown and he probably smirked when the networks likeminded Jay Bilas tweeted Crow actually it tastes like chicken Litos is also a Colonial Athletic Association buff so he knows midmajors The CAA has produced two of the most compelling Cinderella stories in the last half decade if you count George Mason scrapping its way to a Final Four in 2006 Thats my point I guess about the whole Cinderella thing When they get the chance theyre winning these basketball games Litos said So when does the moniker no longer apply Do we still consider Gonzaga a Cinderella after its made every tournament since 1999 Though you could argue VCU still needs to do some resume building Butler seems to have earned its cred So what about the Bulldogs After consecutive Final Four appearances and four Sweet 16s in the last seven years is Butler still a Cinderella Read why Butler VCU make great stories Litos said he believes Gonzaga has fairly shed the title Cinderellas typically have minuscule basketball budgets at least compared with the likes of Duke and Kansas they dont often play on television they come from conferences that usually lend only one team to the NCAA tournaments field of 64 and they rarely play powerhouses and then never at home Gonzaga has flipped the script and shown that success is cyclical Litos said Gonzaga now plays more frequently on television which means more money which means better facilities and players which mean more winning Gonzaga just wins he explained Theres a formula in there somewhere Theres just a cycle of success and it starts with winning basketball games Which is exactly what Butler has done in the last two NCAA tournaments and Litos believes itll be next to shake off the yoke of underdoggery Butlers probably on that precipice now he said I have a hard time believing that midmajor or Cinderella apply Interesting stuff this but I know youre thinking its worthless if I dont tell you how to harness the information for next years office pool As this years CNNcom pool winner yes its already over were that bad Id love to give you some insight Here goes I got lucky as hell with my Richmond and Butler picks Lacking any thoughts more useful than that I picked up the phone again  this time for a chat with Ken Pomeroy The Utahbased meteorologist developed tempo statistics which have earned him respect among many a college basketball coach and analyst Dukes Mike Krzyzewski and Butlers Brad Stevens among them Hes also a consultant to the Baylor basketball squad Read why its easy to hate Duke His site kenpomcom focuses less on percentages than it does the pace of the game Rather than looking at shooting percentage over an entire game or season for example he explores playbyplay data and considers how the pace of a game can affect scoring opportunities Surely I thought this master of the quantifiable could give us some pointers on how to determine which underdogs are worth scribbling into our brackets He flatly stated the opposite Youre not going to be able to predict the success of an underdog Sigh Pomeroy for one is not ready to relieve Butler of its underdog status Hed like to see more than two stellar performances before making that assessment he said As for the VCU Rams hes not sure their success is totally their doing Predicting VCU would shine in the tournament would have been difficult Its shooting better in the tournament than it did during the regular season Its playing better defense too Pomeroy said Not to take away anything from what theyve done but teams like Purdue and Kansas played pretty bad games against them he said How much of it was just Kansas laying an egg I dont know how you figure that one out Few do Of almost 6 million entrants into ESPNcoms bracket challenge only two picked the Final Four Yes two Pomeroy told me that on paper Kentucky and Butler should meet in the NCAA Final then in the next breath said predictions are silly But theyre fun and lets be honest the first two rounds of the tournament wouldnt be as tantalizing without the Cinderellas Theyre the reason such a ludicrous percentage of the adult population scrambles to enter pools with friends and coworkers the reason we monitor scores on our smartphones or head to lunch at the sports bar come tourney time Theyre also the reason that dilettantes who pick the winners by team color or mascot ferocity have the same chance as Litos or Pomeroy of winning a pool The talent gaps between teams especially in the later rounds arent all that disparate so success hinges more on intangibles such as hot streaks and moxie '

aS'Searching for alien life Check out failed stars\nPotential exists on freefloating planets and subbrown dwarfs researcher says The search for alien life usually focuses on planets around other stars But a lesserknown possibility is that life has sprung up on planets that somehow were ejected from their original solar systems and became freefloating in the universe as well as on small bodies called subbrown dwarfs which are stars so small and dim they are not really stars at all but function more like planets Studies show these bodies could potentially host atmospheres and surfaces where some form of extraterrestrial life could take hold Researcher Viorel Badescu of the Polytechnic University of Bucharest in Romania recently investigated the possibilities for life on freefloating planets FFPs and subbrown dwarfs SBDs that might contain lakes of the chemical ethane He found that such life is not impossible though it would be significantly different from life on Earth His findings were detailed in the August 2010 issue of the journal Planetary and Space Science Failed stars Subbrown dwarfs are not large enough to generate the nuclear fusion that powers normal stars Having failed as stars they slowly radiate their internal thermal energy as heat and very dim light  hence they are extremely hard to detect Both freefloating planets and subbrown dwarfs dont always orbit around a parent star and can be found in interstellar space Lacking a star life on FFPs and SBDs would have to rely on the bodys internal heat and the decay of radioactive elements for energy One may expect a rather stable heat release for long periods of time exceeding two or three times the present age of the solar system said Badescu Though meager this heat could be trapped on the object by an optically thick atmosphere But life needs more than just heat to thrive Another important ingredient for habitability is a solvent  a liquid environment where important chemical reactions can occur Life on Earth uses water as a solvent but thats not the only option Synthesis of observational data makes it possible to conceive chemical reactions that might support life involving noncarbon compounds occurring in solvents other than water Badescu wrote in his paper In particular Badescu found that ethane  a compound of carbon and hydrogen  could function well as a solvent for alien life Life without water It seems odd to consider the possibility of life on an object more massive than Jupiter or Saturn especially since most scientists think such gas giant planets  with their high radiation hostile atmospheres and potential lack of a planetary surface  would not harbor life as we know it But Badescu said that some subbrown dwarfs might have lakes or oceans of liquid ethane that could prove quite homey to alien microbes The main difference between water and ethane for use as a solvent is that water is a polar molecule meaning one end of the molecule is positively charged and one end of it is negatively charged This has proven integral to Earth life because the polar properties of water enable certain kinds of molecules to dissolve easily in water while others remain stable NASA  JPLCaltech In this illustration twin brown dwarfs orbit each other Despite the name brown dwarf these objects cool and change over time and therefore do not have a definitive color The molecules that code for life  DNA and RNA  have electrical charge properties that allow them to change their internal structure  the specific order of the base molecules within them  and still have the same overall physical properties This is all enabled by the way their charge properties interact with the polar quality of water That would not be the case with ethane which is a nonpolar molecule With DNA and RNA in this situation small changes in molecular structure may create large changes in molecular behavior Badescu said That is not acceptable in an encoding biopolymer that must support Darwinian evolution in which case the molecules physical properties must remain relatively constant when the informational content changes However the challenge is not insurmountable  a completely different type of molecule could be used to code lifes blueprint on a FFP or SBD Searching for life Ultimately freefloating planets and subbrown dwarfs could prove a fertile place to look for extraterrestrial creatures Besides their habitable qualities these bodies seem to be quite common in the universe Subbrown dwarfs weighing between 1 and 13 Jupiter masses may be about as common as stars Badescu said The total number of FFPs and SBDs may exceed the number of stars by two orders of magnitude although most of them should be lowmass rockice planetary embryos ejected from planetary systems in formation ie not the type with large gaseous atmospheres that would retain the heat required for life Badescu said Thus it might be conceivable that FFPs and SBDs are the most common sites of life in the universe '

aS'The Mars Connection\nJeffrey Marlow a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology writes from New Mexico where he is measuring sand particle sizes layer thicknesses and angles to address questions about volcanoes and rock patterns on Mars Saturday March 26 The base surge deposits of Kilbourne Hole and Hunts Hole are part of a much larger story a story that starts on the desolate plains of Mars in 2003 As the Mars Exploration Rover MER Opportunity started surveying its outpost it found several tantalizing features that pointed to a waterrich history There was the crossbedding the salt minerals that seemed to precipitate from an evaporating lake and the famed blueberries  accretionary spherules formed by the movement of water through local rock But science is all about exhausting every opportunity to prove a theory wrong and only then accepting it with caveats of probability and likelihood Many of the devils advocates pointed to base surge deposits  citing the crossbedding and lapilli spheres  as viable alternatives suggesting that the sedimentary environment on Mars was volcanic Lauren Edgar the doctoral student leading our expedition also works on the MER missions and she recalls There was a lot of debate about the origin of the sediment  was it deposited in damp to wet subaqueous conditions or was it part of a volcanic base surge deposit like the ones were observing at Kilbourne Hole and Hunts Hole Jeffrey Marlow Volcanic Rocks Just North of the Border Into a Lunar Training Ground Distinguishing between these possibilities has tested the rovers scientific arsenal On Earth we usually have a lot more context so its easier to make these distinctions says Lauren But on Mars when youre dealing with just a small snapshot of the deposit it can be a lot harder Despite the cosmetic similarities the rover teams consensus at the moment is that water was required to produce some of the sedimentary features that Opportunity has encountered Nonetheless its pretty likely that base surge deposits  volcanic or impactinduced  are abundant on Mars John Grotzinger is advising Laurens work with the maar deposits and is the project scientist for the coming Mars Science Laboratory mission The early history of Mars was characterized by enormous numbers of bolide impacts that struck the surface of Mars sending plumes of debris high into the atmosphere he notes As these plumes settled back down to the surface they created base surge deposits Thus establishing a set of criteria to help distinguish base surge sediments from waterbased deposits is a critical step in reconstructing ancient Martian environments As John puts it Its important that we be able to distinguish the two since only subaqueous conditions have strong potential as habitable environments One potentially useful marker weve noticed here in New Mexico is the distribution of lapilli  the ashy hailstones that fall out of a cloud of volcanic debris While the blueberry concretions on Mars are distributed throughout the rock here the spherules occur only in certain layers reflecting the periodic discrete nature of the volcanic hailstorms Initial results also suggest that the sudden changes in grain size between rock layers and the specific angles of the sedimentary signatures may be additional criteria to help diagnose a base surge deposit As the sun sets on our final evening and periodic dust devils swirl on the desert plain to the south I look into the crater and find it easy to imagine myself on Mars Cue the red filter cut the vegetation dial the thermostat back a bit and you would be hard pressed to tell the two worlds apart Of course the differences between the Red and Blue Planets are significant and with continued sedimentological studies on Mars  and Earthbased analogues like Hunts Hole and Kilbourne Hole  we should be able to paint a more complete picture of what Mars was like in the past As with most fieldwork much of the real work comes back in the lab as samples are processed and photographs are analyzed but its clear that base surge deposits produce unique depositional features that will hopefully be resolvable with current and future Mars missions With samples stowed and a healthy sheen of desert dust covering us we head back to El Paso leaving the craters to the coyotes '

aS'Can painkillers prevent melanoma\nBy Alison McCook NEW YORK Reuters Health  New findings add to confusion over whether taking aspirin ibuprofen or related painkillers reduces the risk of developing melanoma Animal experiments have suggested that the class of painkillers known as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs could play a role in preventing melanoma but a large 2008 study failed to find any evidence to support this possibility Now a smaller study that asked people with melanoma and those without the disease to recall their use of NSAIDs has found that taking these drugs  particularly aspirin  at least once a week for more than 5 years may have offered some protection against the deadly disease The findings are interesting but should not lead people to conclude that popping a few painkillers will reduce their risk of skin cancer cautioned Dr Maryam Asgari of Kaiser Permanente Northern California and the University of California San Francisco who coauthored the 2008 study NSAIDs  which include aspirin naproxen marketed as Aleve and ibuprofen Advil  have side effects she noted such as stomach bleeding People with a family history of melanoma are better off wearing sunscreen and getting regular skin checks from a dermatologist Asgari recommended I think its just too early to say NSAIDs offer any protection she said I think the jury is still out Theres reason to hope NSAIDs might offer some protection against this type of cancer however  earlier this year a review found that people who use painkillers such as ibuprofen on a regular basis may be less likely to get bladder cancer Other research has consistently supported the benefits of NSAIDs in preventing colorectal cancer and provided some evidence they may work for breast esophagus and stomach cancers as well Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer killing almost 9000 people in the US last year according to the National Cancer Institute To investigate whether NSAIDs offer any protection Dr Clara CurielLewandrowski of Harvard Medical School and the University of Arizona asked 400 people diagnosed with melanoma and 600 similar people without the disease to recall their use of the painkillers The researchers found that people without cancer had a longer history of taking NSAIDs than people who eventually developed melanoma Specifically more than 40 percent of people who were cancerfree said theyd been taking NSAIDs at least once per week for more than 5 years versus only 28 percent of those who developed melanoma Overall regular use of NSAIDs for more than 5 years appeared to reduce the risk of developing cancer by more than 40 percent the authors report in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology Unfortunately the technique  comparing people with melanoma to those without  is fraught with potential problems said Asgari For one you have to get the comparison right she noted theres always a concern that people without cancer who agree to participate in the study may be more health conscious to begin with and its this that protects them from cancer not their use of NSAIDs Did you somehow get a biased sample of people and is that why youre seeing this difference Her 2008 study analyzed data from nearly 64000 people who were melanomafree at the beginning of the investigation then followed them for a few years to see who developed the disease She and her colleagues found no evidence that taking NSAIDs had any effect on risk of developing the deadly skin cancer As a result I wouldnt recommend taking NSAIDs to reduce melanoma just based on this new study Asgari noted SOURCE bitlyhjf0o1 Journal of Investigative Dermatology March 10 2011 '

aS'Vegetarians may be at lower diabetes heart risk\nBy Kerry Grens NEW YORK Reuters Health  A new study finds that a meatfree diet seems to lower a persons likelihood of having certain risk factors for diabetes or heart disease  and therefore may lower the risk of one day developing those illnesses Researchers measured a suite of factors  blood sugar blood fats blood pressure waist size and body mass  that when elevated add up to metabolic syndrome and found that vegetarians were lower than nonvegetarians on all counts except cholesterol Having metabolic syndrome puts people at a greater risk of developing diabetes or heart disease in the future In the study 23 out of every 100 vegetarians were found to have at least three metabolic syndrome factors compared with thirtynine out of every 100 nonvegetarians and 37 out of every 100 semivegetarians I was expecting there should be a difference said Nico Rizzo of Loma Linda University the lead researcher on the study But I didnt expect that it would be that much Rizzo and his colleagues analyzed the diet health and lifestyles of more than 700 adults Using questionnaires on eating habits the researchers categorized participants as vegetarians eating meat of any kind less than once a month semivegetarians eating meat or poultry less than once a week and nonvegetarians The researchers also measured sugar fat and cholesterol in the subjects blood as well as blood pressure waist size and body mass index BMI  a measurement of a persons weight relative to height Vegetarians average BMI of 257 was four points lower than that of nonvegetarians who on average had BMIs close to 30 A BMI greater than 25 is considered overweight and greater than 30 is considered obese Semivegetarians fell in the middle with a BMI and waist size smaller than nonvegetarians but larger than vegetarians The pattern held when the measurements were combined to determine the presence of metabolic syndrome Rizzo told Reuters Health he is not sure whats behind the differences Is it primarily the meat intake the plant food intake or a combination of both Rizzo said Its also possible that diet is not the cause the research showed only an association between food choices and health factors not causeandeffect High BMI for instance one of the traits that make up the metabolic syndrome profile itself contributes to high blood pressure and indirectly blood sugar and thereby potentially raising a persons risk of heart disease and diabetes The current study published in the journal Diabetes Care also did not follow the subjects over the long term to see whether those who abstained from meat actually had lower rates of diabetes or heart disease The data for this research which was funded by the National Institutes of Health came from the Adventist Health Study 2 a long term study of Seventh Day Adventists This religious group has considerably more vegetarians than the general population In this study 35 percent of the subjects did not eat meat whereas only about five percent of all Americans are vegetarian One of the differences Rizzo discovered between the groups was age Vegetarians on average were 3 years older than the meateaters Even though theyre older theyre in better shape Rizzo said Thats something I found quite interesting SOURCE bitlygoHGBG Diabetes Care online March 16 2011 '

aS'The Geoid Why a map of Earths gravity yields a potatoshaped planet\nThis video is no Aprils fool joke Earth really is shaped like a potato However the shape that you see here is um slightly exaggerated to highlight its irregularities Another caveat what is depicted here is not the shape of the planet but rather the shape of an idealized sealevel surface extending around the entire globea surface that Earth scientists call the geoid The video is the most accurate reconstruction of the geoid to date and was released by the European Space Agency at a scientific meeting in Munich on March 31 see a video of the related press conference here It is based on data collected by ESAs Gravity Field and SteadyState Ocean Circulation Explorer GOCE The fivemeter long arrowheadshaped probe has been in a low orbit for almost exactly two years collecting painstakingly accurate measurements of the gravitational field of Earth Alas many of the Web sites and blogs that reported on GOCEs results so far got it wrong Contrary to what was stated in these reports the geoid is not a surface on which the strength of gravity is the same at every point The geoid is in the words of an oceanographer on the GOCE team a surface such that if you placed a marble anywhere on it it would stay there rather than rolling in any direction Another way of saying it is imagine you were an engineer traveling around the world with a level Then wherever you go the level would be exactly parallel to the geoid at that place Yet another equivalent definition it is a surface thats everywhere perpendicular to the direction of a plumbbob or in other words to the gravitational field Gravity need not have the same strength everywhere on the geoid In other words if you could walk on the geoid you would see gravity always pointing exactly downwards but your weight could slightly change from one region to another The misunderstanding may have stemmed from the confusion of two concepts from multivariable calculus a vector field and its potential The vector field in this case is the gravity field and the potential is the gravitational potential which is essentially the gravitational energy of a unit mass At any point in space the gravity field can be seen as the direction in which the gravitational potential rises fastest Its magnitude or length is the rate of change of the potential The field defined this way is called the gradient vector field of the potential In general the gradient of a quantity defined in space is the 3D version of the derivative of a quantity in the sense of singlevariable calculus To be pedantic for historical reasons the gravity field is defined to be the opposite vector to the gradient of the potential If you were to follow a gravitational field linea curve which is at every point tangent to the vector field at that pointyou would follow a curve of steepest ascent on the gravitational potential Thats why it is called the gradient Note that because of inertia the field lines of the gravitational field are not necessarily the trajectories of a body in free fall The field wont tell you in which direction youll be movingonly in which direction you will accelerate  Gradient vector fields are difficult to grasp in 3D because picturing the potential to visualize the ascent or descent would require a fourth dimension But a 2D analogy might help Think of how water trickles down a hilly surface Neglecting inertia a droplet of water would follow a curve of steepest descent which is a vector field made of vectors along the surface In this analogy the elevation of the droplet is the analogue of the potential at that point And the analogue of the geoid is an elevation contour on a topographical map the potentialthe heightis constant along the contour Obviously some parts of this contour can be on steep terrain whereas others can be on mild gradients On a topographical map the slope is steeper where many different contour lines are crowded together The magnitude of the gradient vector fieldwhich represents the steepness of a slopeis not the same at all points of the contour Thus gravity does change in strength along the geoid and so the geoid is not a shape where the gravity is the same no matter where you stood on it as one blogger put it Nor is it how the Earth would look like if its shape were distorted to make gravity the same everywhere on its surface as reported by a major news site which went on to add that areas of strongest gravity are in yellow and weakest in blue apparently not noticing the contradiction with the previous sentence There are many reasons why the geoid isnt a sphere First and foremost the Earth itself isnt a sphere It is closer to an ellipsoid being flattened at the poles by the centrifugal force of its own rotation But the planet isnt an ellipsoid either because of topography Mountains and valleys are asymmetrical distributions of mass That mass distribution affects the gravitational field and makes the geoid asymmetrical too Then there is Earths inner and outer structure The oceanic crust and the landmasses of the continental shelves are made of different materials that have different densities and farther down the mantle is not uniform either with regions that have slightly different compositions and temperatures and thus slightly different densities The variations Reiner Rummel a senior GOCE scientist told me in an email reflect processes in the deep earth mantle such as descending tectonic plates and hot mantle plumes All of which affects the strength of the gravitational field and the GOCEs orbit The probe measures these effects thus it measures the gravitational field The geoid is not to be confused with anomalies due to the topography of the land  although it is affected in part by it Alsoand here is where things get really trickyit is not to be confused with the actual sea level Wait a minute you say but isnt the ocean supposed to be at sea level by definition Except for relatively small perturbations such as waves or tides you say shouldnt the surface be exactly horizontal that is perpendicular to the gravitational field everywhere Isnt that after all what sea level means Yes to some approximation However the oceans are not homogenous Differences of salinity and temperature make them more or less dense Moreover the Earths rotation produces forces that keep the oceans in constant motion Just like the water in a river is not all at the same levelafter all it flows to the sea for a reasonthe water in the ocean also has differences in height And by height it should be clear by now I mean elevation relative to the geoid which can be positive or negative Oceanographers thus speak of the topography of the ocean meaning that it really has hills and valleys In fact here is where the ocean circulation part of GOCEs name comes into play one of the main goals of the mission is to measure the oceans topography and from that deduce the structure of the oceanic currents The deviations of the geoid from the simplified ellipsoidal model of the Earth are substantial they range from 100 meters below dark blue in the video to 80 meters above yellow Rummel says The surface in the video is the geoid amplified by a factor 7000 says GOCE mission manager Rune Floberghagen '

aS'The Amazing Disappearing Neutrino\nBy Eugenie Samuel Reich of Nature magazine Neutrinos have long perplexed physicists with their uncanny ability to evade detection with as many as twothirds of the ghostly particles apparently going missing en route from the Sun to Earth Now a refined version of an old calculation is causing a stir by suggesting that researchers have also systematically underestimated the number of the particles antimatter partners  antineutrinos  produced by nuclear reactor experiments The deficit could be caused by the antineutrinos turning into socalled sterile antineutrinos which cant be directly detected and which would be clear evidence for effects beyond the standard model of particle physics In the 1960s physicist Ray Davis working deep underground in the Homestake gold mine in South Dakota found that the flux of solar neutrinos hitting Earth was a third of that predicted by calculations of the nuclear reactions in the Sun by theorist John Bahcall Davis later received a Nobel prize for his contributions to neutrino astrophysics That puzzle was considered solved in 2001 when the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory SNO in Canada found the missing twothirds through an alternative means of detection The SNOs results were taken as evidence that neutrinos have a mass which allows them to oscillate between three flavors electron muon and tau Davis had only detected the electron neutrinos Experiments that measure the rate of antineutrino production from the decay of uranium and plutonium isotopes have so far produced results roughly consistent with this theory But the revised calculation accepted this week by Physical Review D suggests that its not the whole story While waiting for the Double Chooz neutrino experiment in France to become fully operational Thierry Lasserre and his colleagues at the French atomic energy commissionCEA in Saclay set out to check predictions of the rate of antineutrino production by nuclear reactors They repeated a calculation first done in the 1980s by Klaus Schreckenbach at the Technical University of Munich using more modern techniques that allowed them to be much more precise Their new estimate of the rate of production is around 3 more than previously predicted This means that several generations of neutrino and antineutrino experiments have unknowingly missed a small fraction of the particles It was completely a surprise for us says Lasserre Double Chooz consists of two detectors measuring the flux of antineutrinos produced by the Chooz nuclear power plant in the French Ardennes one detector about 400 meters away from the plant and the other 1 kilometer away The far detector became operational this year Stefan Schnert a neutrino physicist at the Technical University of Munich says the calculation is solid and has been checked with Schreckenbach They can reproduce each others results Theres no way around this result Its very solid Art McDonald of Queens University in Kingston Canada and the SNO says that people have to look carefully at the calculation which may itself have a systematic error But he adds theres no doubt it would have significance as a physics result if it can be shown with more accuracy The result may be pointing to evidence of neutrinos and antineutrinos oscillating into a fourth kind of neutrino or antineutrino a socalled sterile version that doesnt interact with ordinary matter says Carlo Giunti a physicist at the University of Turin in Italy Other experiments have previously seen evidence for sterile particles including the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and the Mini Booster Neutrino Experiment or MiniBooNE at Fermilab in Batavia Illinois and the search to confirm their existence is a hot area of physics Giunti says that the magnitude of the anomaly uncovered by Lasserre is not statistically significant on its own but that it points promisingly in the same direction as another anomaly found by the SAGE collaboration which studied neutrinos from a radioactive source at the Baksan Neutrino Observatory in the Caucasus in 2005 Before this there used to be a contradiction between reactor and radioactive source experiments but now they are in agreement says Giunti Schnert says that one key experiment everyone is waiting for is a measurement showing that the rate of disappearance of antineutrinos from a source increases with the distance from it This would be the smoking gun he says This article is reproduced with permission from the magazine Nature  The article was first published on April 1 2011 '

aS'Disgraced Dave Attwood hopes England will still come calling after ban for stamping\nOne boot in the face a whole heap of consequences Dave Attwood has spent the past four months pondering such matters Given that he has got a degree in physics and philosophy from Bristol University he is well equipped to get his head around delicate issues Attwood has had plenty on which to reflect notably the fallout from a stamping incident in December against La Rochelle that led to a nineweek suspension In its wake came demotion from the England senior squad putting in jeopardy an international career that had barely begun It had all looked so rosy a summer tour to Australia last season two caps from the bench in November and promise of things to come And now The World Cup is a remote prospect all the more so given that Attwood is struggling to even get a start with Gloucester He has managed 86 minutes playing time since the New Year On Saturday afternoon he again has to make do with a place on the bench against Newcastle Attwood is a chastened man acknowledging that a badboy reputation was starting to take shape He was cited for stamping on tour to Australia only for the case to be dismissed on a technicality It was reckless petulant and daft says Attwood of the La Rochelle incident It was a very unfortunate episode one that has put a brake on everything At the time Attwood was not fully aware of what had happened although the fact that a bunch of Frenchies spent the best part of an hour swinging punches told me that Id done something He had In the 15th minute of the Amlin Challenge Cup game against La Rochelle at Kingsholm Attwoods boot came down on the face of the oppositions Romanian prop Petrisor Toderasc He had been tugged back by Toderasc and had struck out Toderasc was taken to Gloucester Royal Infirmary that Sunday night but was released following treatment for broken teeth cheekbone damage and cuts Two days later reports from France suggested that Toderascs sight was in danger That Tuesday night was a pretty dark time for me Attwood says It was quite horrifying to think that someone might lose their sight I dont play rugby to go out to hurt people Im not a malicious bloke or a nasty player I dont want to be known as an enforcer Toderasc had not been blinded but Attwood was cited and banned for nine weeks In January he was left out of Englands Elite Player Squad The punishment was salutary and farreaching It was completely my fault and I got what I deserved Attwood says candidly Ive borne the brunt of it Nine weeks has turned into 16 weeks Yes I have learnt a lesson from it Ive tarnished my reputation and Ive got to work hard to recover that Attwood has come to realise that topend rugby simply does not tolerate foul play I was brought up playing rugby in Bristol where you took your medicine Attwood says I always knew that you werent allowed to do things but there would always be a but in my mind There isnt any more You simply cant take the law into your own hands Its been difficult to get to grips with that to get that blueprint in your mind Im more reflective now more aware You do have to turn the other cheek Ive got to ensure that it doesnt happen again Of course in my position youve got to be aggressive and not take a backward step But the game at this level is about power performance and physicality Thats how you really leave your mark Thats what being a hard man means Attwood is an engaging character articulate honest forthright and selfaware He realises that his England prospects are bleak It would be foolish not to admit that Ive significantly damaged my chances he says  It will be nigh on impossible now to squeeze back in Im resigned to that fact England is not a realistic ambition at the moment Doing all that I can for Gloucester is And that will not be for much longer Attwood 24 on Tuesday has signed for West Country rivals Bath for next season He does not believe that his lack of starting opportunities for Gloucester is anything to do with the fact that he is moving on I havent been frozen out at all more that Gloucester have had a great run of form said Attwood noting ruefully that his only start was in the 5315 defeat by Harlequins last weekend That was a humping Time is running out here and I owe Gloucester a massive amount Moving to Bath was a very difficult decision But Gloucester owner Tom Walkinshaws passing in December put contract talks on hold Bath came in with an incredibly attractive offer I can understand talk about loyalty and all that but it was about providing for my future England are still keeping a close eye on Attwood He might yet get his chance in the Churchill Cup in June They welcome the fact that he has got a bit of edge to him There have been no conversations with England about changing my ways Attwood says I guess they feel Im bright enough to take it all on board It has been a formative year in the life of Attwood rising from relative obscurity to win England honours In hindsight that was the easy bit As Attwood comes to terms with taxing realities you fancy the philosophy element of his degree will prove useful Ive got to show that Ive got the character to cope with all this Attwood says And thats exactly what I intend to do '

aS'Report urges study of gay transgender health\nWASHINGTON  Scientists only recently learned how certain diseases affect women differently than men and blacks differently than whites Now a major new report says its time to study the unique health needs of gay and transgender people too Stigma often keeps lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people from seeking health care  and when they do theres little research to guide doctors in their treatment the Institute of Medicine reported Thursday Changing that starts with a seemingly simple step Researchers should start asking people about their sexual orientation and gender identity in all governmentfunded health studies the panel said The report is intended as technical advice to the National Institutes of Health But to the gayrights community the recommendations from such a prestigious scientific group promise to legitimize a quest for greater health equality This community is just ignored said Brian Moulton of the Human Rights Campaign This is going to spark a longterm commitment to dealing with these issues The chairman of the report however anticipates some political criticism This is a scientific report not an advocacy report said Dr Robert Graham professor of family medicine at the University of Cincinnati Whatever your politics as long as you accept the premise that every American ought to have the opportunity for the same health status and the same degree of health then you really have to understand what the different influences are that may keep certain populations away from having that opportunity The IOM panel couldnt even find a good estimate of how many people identify themselves as lesbian gay bisexual or transgender It stressed that these are separate populations that require separate assessments of their needs at different ages California is one of the few states where researchers collect data on LGBT issues Last week the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research reported that older gays lesbians and bisexuals are more prone to high blood pressure and psychological distress than heterosexuals Moreover they are more likely to live alone without children or partners to provide care and support Nationally what is known The AIDS virus remains a threat to young men particularly black men who have sex with men the report noted But the IOM panel also identified far broader issues Increased risks of depression suicide attempts homelessness and being victims of violence Possibly higher rates of smoking and substance use Lesbians and bisexual women may get less preventive care and have higher rates of obesity and breast cancer In addition laws barring samesex marriage often limit access to health insurance and there are few health providers trained to treat transgender patients in particular in a culturally competent manner the report said AP '

aS'Richard Feynman the Thinker\nIn the heyday of the physicist Richard P Feynman which ensued after his death in 1988 a publishing entrepreneur might have been tempted to start a book club of works by and about him Offered as main selections would be Feynmans autobiographical rambles as told to Ralph Leighton  Surely Youre Joking Mr Feynman  and  What Do You Care What Other People Think  For alternate selections readers could choose from his more serious works like QED The Strange Theory of Light and Matter  a spirited account of the counterintuitive behavior of the quantum world  and the legendary Feynman Lectures on Physics Whatever the man said had swagger For those who would rather listen there are recordings of the lectures and of Feynman playing his bongos He was an irresistible subject for biographers and as he called himself in two of his subtitles a curious character indeed The best biography James Gleicks Genius captured the ebullience  sometimes winning sometimes exasperating  and gave lucid explanations of some hard physics Those seeking a more mathematical treatment could turn to Jagdish Mehras thick book The Beat of a Different Drum while for a lighter touch there was Christopher Sykess No Ordinary Genius The Illustrated Richard Feynman It is hard to imagine that the world needs another Feynman biography but here it is In Quantum Man Richard Feynmans Life in Science Lawrence M Krauss director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University makes his own way through the subject and emerges with an enlightening addition to the field Krauss  like Feynman a physicist as well as an author  has written seven books including The Physics of Star Trek Though he couldnt resist recycling some wellworn Feynman anecdotes and providing a couple of his own he concentrates on Feynman the thinker and on the contributions that merited his fame It is not something easily summarized Einstein discovered relativity Murray GellMann discovered the quark And Feynman Well there was that thing he did on TV with the Oring and the ice water showing why the Challenger had disintegrated But to physicists he is famous for something more obscure cleaning up the mathematical mess known as quantum electrodynamics  an ambitious attempt to explain light and matter using two great theories quantum mechanics and special relativity In 1965 he shared a Nobel Prize with two colleagues Julian Schwinger and SinItiro Tomonaga who solved the problem in different ways But Feynmans sum over paths approach expressed in the lines and squiggles of what became known as Feynman diagrams opened up a more intuitive understanding of the subatomic realm It was as Krauss puts it a beautiful pictorial way of thinking about quantum mechanics Other good books give a feel for this and Feynmans later accomplishments But I understood it all better after watching over the shoulder of Krauss the physicist as he worked his way through the Feynman oeuvre  not the stories of fast times in Rio but the scientific papers In popular lore Feynman often comes off as the wild man of physics throwing out one crazy idea after another in a frenzied search for truth In Quantum Man  part of the Great Discoveries series for which I have also written a book  we see more of his other side a master mathematician who could concentrate on a problem for hours and then recast it in a surprising new manner In following the chain of ideas that led to Feynmans Nobel Krauss begins with a familiar phenomenon  the way a light ray takes a sudden bend when it enters a pool of water The angle can be calculated using a staple of high school physics called Snells law but in the 17th century Pierre de Fermat provided a deeper explanation the light beam acts as though it were trying to minimize its total travel time Light moves more slowly in water than in air so it adjusts its course ensuring that it spends no longer than necessary in the denser medium The idea is not that the light beam is thinking ahead but that the universe is somehow structured so it appears that way During the next century mathematicians showed that Newtons laws of motion could be rewritten in a similar vein an orbiting planet or a hurtling cannonball moves as though it were trying to minimize a more abstract quantity called action Krauss gives readers a feel for what that means and shows how Feynman retooled the idea to solve some nagging problems in subatomic physics One of sciences great puzzles still only partly solved is how to reconcile the regularities of classical physics  like the bending light beam  with the probabilistic laws of quantum mechanics Light after all consists of photons which are capable of doing all kinds of strange things In moving from A to B a photon may take any number of different paths even ones that seem absurd  spiraling in curlicues changing speeds in midair With Feynmans method these acrobatics can be added together the weirdest ones canceling one another out to yield the motion we observe in the familiar world This triumph came early in his career His later thinking about solidstate physics for example or quantum cosmology was just as original Maybe sometimes too original Krauss suggests Science usually proceeds by building on what came before The maverick in Feynman kept him from accepting even the most established ideas until he had torn them apart and reassembled the pieces That led to a deeper understanding but his time might have been better spent at the cutting edge He continued to push physics forward as few modern scientists have Krauss writes but he tended to lead from the rear or at best from a side flank Like those quantum particles he seemed eager to try every path  even the crazy ones That was true in his life as well as in his physics George Johnson is the author of eight books including Strange Beauty Murray GellMann and the Revolution in TwentiethCentury Physics '

aS'Simple injection could cure cat allergies\nResearchers are working on a vaccine that could prevent itching sneezing and watery eyes caused by cat allergies that affect one in 10 people Tests with a simple injection have so far been successful and it has been found not only to be safe and effective but it also lasts longer than current treatment Further trials have yet to be carried out but if they are successful it is hoped the principle can be applied to treat hay fever sufferers and people with other allergies The research was carried out by Circassia a biotechnology company based in Oxford and the McMaster University in Ontario Canada Steve Harris chief executive of Circassia said that the results are extremely good news By achieving a significant reduction in symptoms after just four doses whilst also proving extremely well tolerated our novel Tcell vaccine has demonstrated the true potential of ToleroMunie to revolutionise allergy treatment In the past regular allergy shots have been considered to be the best way to treat allergies but that is difficult and expensive Professor Mark Larchs findings were published in the Journal of Allergy  Clinical Immunology They used the blood of 100 volunteers to see how their Tcells  the sells that fight infection  react with protein found on cats fur They then took amino acids to create synthetic versions of the proteins They found seven peptides strings of amino acids Those synthetic peptides were mixed together to make the vaccine said Larch We picked the peptides that would work in as much of the population as possible The volunteers were then given a low dose of the vaccine four to eight times a year and it was discovered that the side effects associated with traditional shots did not occur They were then subjected to cat allergens and recorded the change in their symptoms It was found that patients experienced a 55 per cent greater improvement in their symptoms The next phase of the trials will involve a much larger group of sufferers when it is hoped researchers will be able to find the optimal dose Beyond treating cat allergies they hope to use the therapy for people who are allergic to house dust mite ragweed grass birch tree and moulds '

aS'Pour on the Syrup   Its Good For You\nResearchers have identified compounds in maple syrup with similar antiinflammatory or antioxidant properties as blueberries green tea and other superfoods In our laboratory research we found that several of these compounds possess antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties which have been shown to fight cancer diabetes and bacterial illnesses said lead researcher Navindra Seeram assistant professor of pharmacognosy at the University of Rhode Island Initial studies also suggest that polyphenols in the syrup may help keep blood sugar levels in check important for diabetics by inhibiting enzymes that are involved in the conversion of carbohydrates to sugar he said The discoveries of new molecules in the syrup also provide chemists with leads that could prompt synthesis of medications to fight other diseases The findings were presented this week at an annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Anaheim California and are to be published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Functional Foods The study was funded by the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers and Agriculture and AgriFood Canada A total of 54 beneficial compounds were identified by the researchers in pure maple syrup from Quebec including five of which have never been seen in nature Among the new compounds is quebecol  named in honor of the Canadian province of Quebec which leads the world in maple syrup production The researchers believe it is created when a farmer boils off the water in maple sap to get maple syrup It takes 40 liters 205 gallons of sap to make one liter two pints of syrup The sweet sap is collected from maple trees in the spring when freezing and thawing cycles cause it to rise and flow from taps hammered into tree trunks Seeram said the irony of finding a potential antidiabetes compound in a sweetener is not lost on him Not all sweeteners are created equal he said But while it may make a good substitute for high fructose corn syrup on pancakes he discourages anyone from going out and drinking gallons of it in hopes of extracting the benefits '

aS'Genetically modified cows produce human milk\nScientists have created genetically modified cattle that produce human milk in a bid to make cows milk more nutritious The scientists have successfully introduced human genes into 300 dairy cows to produce milk with the same properties as human breast milk Human milk contains high quantities of key nutrients that can help to boost the immune system of babies and reduce the risk of infections The scientists behind the research believe milk from herds of genetically modified cows could provide an alternative to human breast milk and formula milk for babies which is often criticised as being an inferior substitute They hope genetically modified dairy products from herds of similar cows could be sold in supermarkets The research has the backing of a major biotechnology company The work is likely to inflame opposition to GM foods Critics of the technology and animal welfare groups reacted angrily to the research questioning the safety of milk from genetically modified animals and its effect on the cattles health But Professor Ning Li the scientist who led the research and director of the State Key Laboratories for AgroBiotechnology at the China Agricultural University insisted that the GM milk would be as safe to drink as milk from ordinary dairy cows He said The milk tastes stronger than normal milk We aim to commercialize some research in this area in coming three years For the humanlike milk 10 years or maybe more time will be required to finally pour this enhanced milk into the consumers cup China is now leading the way in research on genetically modified food and the rules on the technology are more relaxed than those in place in Europe The researchers used cloning technology to introduce human genes into the DNA of Holstein dairy cows before the genetically modified embryos were implanted into surrogate cows Writing in the scientific peerreviewed journal Public Library of Science One the researchers said they were able to create cows that produced milk containing a human protein called lysozyme Lysozyme is an antimicrobial protein naturally found in large quantities in human breast milk It helps to protect infants from bacterial infections during their early days of life They created cows that produce another protein from human milk called lactoferrin which helps to boost the numbers of immune cells in babies A third human milk protein called alphalactalbumin was also produced by the cows The scientists also revealed at an exhibition at the China Agricultural University that they have boosted milk fat content by around 20 per cent and have also changed the levels of milk solids making it closer to the composition of human milk as well as having the same immuneboosting properties Professor Li and his colleagues who have been working with the Beijing GenProtein Biotechnology Company said their work has shown it was possible to humanise cows milk In all the scientists said they have produced a herd of around 300 cows that are able to produce humanlike milk The transgenic animals are physically identical to ordinary cows Writing in the journal Professor Li said Our study describes transgenic cattle whose milk offers the similar nutritional benefits as human milk The modified bovine milk is a possible substitute for human milk It fulfilled the conception of humanising the bovine milk Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph  he added the humanlike milk would provide much higher nutritional content He said they had managed to produce three generations of GM cows but for commercial production there would need to be large numbers of cows produced He said Human milk contains the just right proportions of protein carbohydrates fats minerals and vitamins for an infants optimal growth and development As our daily food the cows milk provided us the basic source of nutrition But the digestion and absorption problems made it not the perfect food for human being The researchers also insist having antimicrobial proteins in the cows milk can also be good for the animals by helping to reduce infections of their udders Genetically modified food has become a highly controversial subject and currently they can only be sold in the UK and Europe if they have passed extensive safety testing The consumer response to GM food has also been highly negative resulting in many supermarkets seeking to source products that are GM free Campaigners claim GM technology poses a threat to the environment as genes from modified plants can get into wild plant populations and weeds while they also believe there are doubts about the safety of such foods Scientists insist genetically modified foods are unlikely to pose a threat to food safety and in the United States consumers have been eating genetically modified foods for more decades However during two experiments by the Chinese researchers which resulted in 42 transgenic calves being born just 26 of the animals survived after ten died shortly after birth most with gastrointestinal disease and a further six died within six months of birth Researchers accept that the cloning technology used in genetic modification can affect the development and survival of cloned animals although the reason why is not well understood A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals said the organisation was extremely concerned about how the GM cows had been produced She said Offspring of cloned animals often suffer health and welfare problems so this would be a grave concern Why do we need this milk  what is it giving us that we havent already got Helen Wallace director of biotechnology monitoring group GeneWatch UK said We have major concerns about this research to genetically modify cows with human genes There are major welfare issues with genetically modified animals as you get high numbers of still births There is a question about whether milk from these cows is going to be safe from humans and it is really hard to tell that unless you do large clinical trials like you would a drug so there will be uncertainty about whether it could be harmful to some people Ethically there are issues about mass producing animals in this way Professor Keith Campbell a biologist at the University of Nottingham works with transgenic animals said Genetically modified animals and plants are not going to be harmful unless you deliberately put in a gene that is going to be poisonous Why would anyone do that in a food Genetically modified food if done correctly can provide huge benefit for consumers in terms of producing better products '

aS'My favourite particle the neutrino\nI started writing about neutrinos because I love them They are quite magical really the Universe is completely swarming with them they are the second most abundant particle after photons but we know practically nothing about them And what we do know is really weird I wrote down My favourite particle the neutrino to fit in with the other particle articles But it isnt my favourite particle I toyed with Not my favourite particle the neutrino but that just felt disrespectful Then I decided it doesnt matter what I write at the top of the page Why do I need this post to fall into line with the others I suppose its because I want symmetry I want that warm comfortableyetexciting feeling you get when starting to read the next book in a trilogy The neutrino was postulated imaginedup for a similar reason the desire for symmetry A hundred years ish ago there was lots of great experimental science going on There was no clear idea what atoms were but there was an understanding that they werent solid balls Ernest Rutherford and others had established through experiments that there was a nucleus in the center of an atom and had postulated that electrons were in orbit around this nucleus He came up with this description based purely on his experimental results there was no theory at the time that predicted this I feel quite nostalgic for this sort of experimentdriven theory In the era of the LHC it is not the done thing to come up with a new theory to describe what we see experimentally In general our results have to fit some theory that has already been proposed When they dont they dont we tune the theoretical predictions to match our data like twiddling a load of knobs most of these theory predictors which we call Monte Carlo have twenty or thirty knobs until we get some agreement I am moaning about this but really we dont have a choice Anyway back to the good old days Something called Beta decay had been observed They had a name for it before they knew it for what it was It was a nice bit of realworld useful observational science It was noticed that some atoms would emit radiation without any provocation to do so This is what we call radioactivity Active radiation Nothing to do with the radio other than that radio also works via radiation Radio is carried by electromagnetic radiation my first love  the photon What radiation is is the loss of energy by something That energy invariably travels somewhere else in some form or other But the thing with radioactivity is it is not deliberate It just happens naturally When first discovered it triggered a whole host of moneymaking schemes similar to modernday homeopathy I suppose except homeopaths make their millions out of plain water and packaging whereas back in the day the quacks were raking it in by selling people radioactive facecream The scientists rebelled lots of people got cancer and the business end closed I laughed at these adverts and showed my mates and then I felt really sad because I thought about people in the future okay the present laughing at my friends for buying 0 proof hogswart Anyway again the science continued and we realized that what was happening was that part of the atom in fact part of the nucleus was decaying It was established that the radiation being emitted was electrons because the measurement of the emitted particles charge and mass was exactly the same as for electrons The electrons werent being thrown out of orbit they were being emitted from the nucleus This is interesting because the atomic nucleus only contains protons with a charge of 1 and neutrons with a charge of zero To get a negatively charged particle out of this we thought that the neutron must decay into a proton and an electron zero charge 1 and 1 Great This fitted nicely with the experimental measurement of the atom before and after it went through Beta decay But this is where things stopped being comfortable This picture predicts precisely the energy that the emitted radiation the electron must have Depending on what kind of atom is doing the decay we should be able to predict exactly how much energy the electron hasWhen they measured the energy carried by these emitted electrons they found that the electrons could have any energy This was a huge problem because conservation of energy was and is the closest we get to feeling comfortable with any knowledge in particle physics It always works We dont have to appeal to the fact that the theory is beautiful and elegant we just do cold hard experiments And warm soft ones Any kind of one We always get the same answer energy is conserved Always But not in radioactivity Wolfgang Pauli wasnt having any of it There must be something else emitted something that the instruments were not detecting Pauli described the properties that this invisible particle must have It is neutral no charge it has a small or zero mass and it has spin half like the electron If the new particle was emitted along with the electron then the electron could have any energy because the total energy emitted could still add up to be the exact value predicted by the theory The new particle would have to be a ghost traveling through matter without interacting at all Then we could explain why it was not detected Of course this was not a comfortable place to be but it was slightly less uncomfortable than violating the law of conservation of energy Pauli was aware of his responsibility famously saying I have done a terrible thing I have postulated a particle that cannot be detected Wolfgang Pauli he knew his stuff Is it okay to make a prediction that we cannot test Science is about trying to describe the way the world works our understanding should be based on what we observe and our theories should be testable This is why some experimentalists laugh at string theory I for one am happy to ignore it until someone comes up with a way for us to test its validity Okay some of the reason I ignore it is because it is hard but I would be much more inclined to make the effort if I thought it was any use Thankfully the little neutral ones neutrinos can be detected It is just very very difficult to do This is because they simply do not interact with the particles that make up matter Neutrinos can fly past an atom as if it were not there They are neutral so they are not affected by electromagnetic fields The only thing in nature they have anything to do with is the weak nuclear force so they tend to just whizz through the universe through planets and through us leaving no trace We do detect the odd one The first was 25 years after Paulis prediction by Cowan and Reines Back in 1987 we saw a whopping 24 of them in just a few seconds thanks to a supernova going off in the vicinity But generally they are a bugger to catch So what do we know about neutrinos now Almost nothing but the little bit we do know is very interesting indeed The standard model of particle physics the theory that we are most happy with when putting together all the little bits of knowledge we have gathered from thousands of experiments over a hundred years tells us that neutrinos have no mass like photons We now know that this is not the case Neutrinos do have mass We know that the three kinds of neutrinos must all have different masses so at least two of them cannot be zero I feel like nobody really talks about this Perhaps I hang out with the wrong kind of physicists Neutrino experiments have shown the standard model to be deeply flawed yet we still persist in calling it the standard model I have finished writing this now without actually saying a single thing about why I love the neutrino I havent mentioned that they are able to change flavour neutrino oscillations or that they could be their own antiparticle are they Majorana or Dirac particles or that they can help us understand dark matter or that the fate of the universe is in their hands Each one of these things is completely deserving of its own post written by someone who knows their onions and is able to write something that is not 90 digression '

aS'Sixers cruise past Nets to clinch playoff spot\nUnlike the theatrical Phillies the Sixers rolled early leaving little doubt that the lowly Nets would limp out of the Wells Fargo Center after enduring their ninth loss in the last 10 games and that the Sixers would be skipping into the playoffs in a few weeks for the first time since 2009 Its a great feeling said forward Elton Brand who will be making the second playoff appearance of his 12year career You dont know until it happens Were glad we handled our business and we dont have to wait for this team or that team to lose We did it in our own manner especially from where we came from 313 and that tough start Coach Doug Collins impressed upon anyone who would listen early in the season how important it was for his two veterans Brand and Andre Iguodala to be leaders on the court and vocal directors The two have not disappointed their coach helping to lead a painfully young team through that tough start It is now not only a playoff team but one that will have a firstround opponent more than a little nervous To do this tonight in front of our home fans is such an accomplishment said Collins who has a chance to lead the Sixers to their first winning season since 200405 EB and Dre really led the way for us And Thad Young has been amazing When he and Lou Williams play like they do off the bench it makes us a whole different team The Sixers had it all running smoothly last night so much so that the normally soppy Collins was pretty much bone dry after the game Young scored a gamehigh 22 including four slam dunks and various other insidethelane finishes Brand added 21 while Jrue Holiday posted 17 points seven assists and six rebounds Iguodala added 14 points and seven assists and did his usual stellar job defensively at times even shutting down Nets AllStar point guard Deron Williams Last season swingman Young made life easy on his defenders many times opting for standstill jump shots This year as designed by Collins Young is torturing foes with dizzying drives to the basket often contorting himself in ways usually saved for a circus He has prospered greatly under Collins tutelage and will be one of the main weapons at his coachs disposal come the postseason Making the playoffs is much more memorable said Young who will be making his third playoff appearance with the club To see where we came from 313 and now weve clinched a playoff spot with our 40th win Its definitely a great feeling and weve got a great group of guys here Were all standup guys we all love each other and were ready to go to battle for each other each and every night The lead grew to as many as 33 early in the fourth quarter enabling Collins to get some muchneeded rest for some of his players especially Iguodala and Brand who have been battling injuries And with the lack of resistance from the Nets for most of the night those who did play significant minutes didnt seem to have to exert much energy Holiday being only 20 often is asked to name his favorite point guards in the league Without hesitation he points out Williams In just his second game back after missing six with a wrist injury Williams didnt do much to cement himself in Holidays idol category scoring only four points in a little more than 22 minutes and dealing seven assists Though he never knows how his tendinitisridden right knee is going to feel Iguodala must have been feeling pretty good at the beginning of the game as he scored 12 points in the first quarter hitting a pair of threepointers and slicing strong to the basket Tonight I think he hit a couple of early jumpers which got him going Collins said I think that really ignites the rest of his game then hes slashing and cutting Hes one of the most unselfish players Ive ever been around Ive never seen a guy who gets more excited for kicking the ball to a guy hitting a shot than he does Iguodalas hot start propelled the big win and allowed for him and Brand to sit the fourth quarter which could come in handy tonight when the team faces the Bucks in Milwaukee Of course Cliff Lee will be taking the mound for the Phillies so to many the Sixers will be an afterthought once again No matter to them They proved that theyre something the Phillies arent yet this year  a playoff team Six shots Every Sixer played at least 5 minutes and Andre Iguodala played the most time a little more than 32 minutes    The Sixers improved to 112 when Thaddeus Young scores 20 or more For more Sixers coverage read the Daily News Sixers blog Sixerville at wwwphillycomSixerville Follow him on Twitter at httptwittercomBobCooney76 '

aS'Calipari sticking with oneanddone approach\nJohn Calipari didnt come up with the oneanddone rule Didnt write it Didnt implement it The Kentucky coach didnt even really approve of it when the NBA decided in 2006 that players needed to be a year removed from high school before heading to the pros Yet Calipari has mastered it in a way few of his peers have pulling off a seemingly impossible task season after season molding the nations top recruiting class into NBAready pros in six short months while somehow getting them to buy into the teamfirst concept in the process Kentucky plays Connecticut in its first Final Four game in 13 years Saturday with a roster headlined by freshmen Brandon Knight Terrence Jones and Doron Lamb A year ago they were all high school seniors Next fall Knight and Jones will likely be getting paid to play And Calipari will welcome another gifted handful of McDonalds AllAmericans and attempt to do it all over again Its the Calipari way And its probably not going anywhere To be the best I really believe you have to have the best players Calipari said You want to be the best You aint coaching them up You can play that game if you choose to Some do and do it well The rosters of Virginia Commonwealth and Butler are stacked with upperclassmen who have bought into the system and flourished as they matured Connecticut is led by charismatic junior Kemba Walker and a pack of underclassmen all of whom are expected to return next fall The Huskies have produced some of the NBAs top players through the years And all of them opted to stay at least two years If we start hearing Coach Ill only be there one year  well we really dont talk that way at UConn UConn coach Jim Calhoun said Calipari hears it all the time and it doesnt bother him even if each season is likely to feature a team full of shooting stars than slowburning comets Calipari has long supported baseballs rule that allows players to enter the draft right out of high school or commit to at least three years of college Man I wish this was the 70s and I had these guys for three years we wouldnt lose any games Calipari said Not that the current structure has proven difficult for him to navigate His teams have won an average of 335 games since the oneanddone rule was instituted He preaches he tries to put together a players first program and the message is attractive to players looking to iron out the wrinkles before becoming millionaires He tells you coming in that hes going to let you play and let you make mistakes but hes going to let you learn from them said Washington Wizards rookie John Wall who played one season for Kentucky before bolting to the NBA He gives you an opportunity to go in there and show your talent and he knows hes a good enough coach that he can go out and get the same type of guy the next year The next class of Wildcats are already set to go If Knight and Jones go pro later this spring theyll be replaced by another talented group led by forward Anthony Davis and point guard Marquis Teague both of whom could have very short stays in Lexington Recruiting talented but highly volatile stars can come at a price The NCAA ordered Memphis to vacate all 38 of its wins during the 200708 season for using an ineligible player believed to be Derrick Rose who spent a season at Memphis before becoming the No 1 overall pick in the 2008 NBA draft Its a risk some programs deem too dangerous Notre Dame coach Mike Brey is reluctant to recruit a player who may only stick around for a season citing the schools academic demands and the entourages that surround some of the nations top players A lot of oneanddone guys come with a lot of coaching already from people helping them along the way said Brey who led the Irish to a 277 record behind senior guard Ben Hansbrough At this point in my career I dont know if I want to deal with that The Irish have been successful with a different type of shortterm players transfers like Hansbrough who came to Notre Dame after two years at Mississippi State Still Hansbrough remained with the school for three seasons sitting out one under NCAA transfer rules before developing into one of the Big Easts best shooters as a junior and senior Besides the outside distractions introducing a oneyear player in a locker room full of veterans could upset the delicate balance of the locker room Butler has made consecutive Final Fours the Butler Way using a lowkey humble approach championed by coach Brad Stevens If the Bulldogs were to bring a hotshot recruit in the chemistry may change and not for the better Were not individuals here were not playing for an individual star or something like that Butler guard Chase Stigall said Were trying to build a program The program was started a long time ago So was Kentuckys though Calipari isnt one to dwell on the past He caused a stir last June when he called the night five Wildcats  four of them freshmen  were selected in the first round of the NBA draft the greatest day in the programs history the schools seven national championships included Calipari is unapologetic in his approach He values experience but he covets talent If I have a choice between a talented team and an experienced team Im taking talent every time he said I can try to figure out how to get them to defend how to play together all of those things Though hes the most accomplished coach when it comes to attracting oneanddones hes hardly alone in the pursuit of potential oneyear phenoms Ohio State rode freshmen Greg Oden and Mike Conley to an appearance in the national title game in 2007 Kevin Love took UCLA to the Final Four in 2008 Kevin Durant played just one season at Texas Same for Michael Beasley at Kansas State The sight of players treating college as a 12month way station between high school and the NBA doesnt sit well with NCAA president Mark Emmert though he is powerless to stop it I would very much like to not have that become the image of intercollegiate basketball even though there are some that do that Emmert said Id certainly like kids to stay in college and prepare themselves for the rest of their lives So would Calipari who says hed love to coach freshman guard Brandon Knight for the next 15 years He entered Saturday knowing he may not coach Knight for 15 more hours Thats fine He didnt make up the rules He swears hes just trying to play by them My best option is to recruit the best players we have the best students we can recruit and then coach em and get em to believe in themselves get em to reach their dreams Calipari said If that is done after a year then Ill deal with it  '

aS'Everton 22 Aston Villa Leighton Baines saves the day for Toffees after brace from Darren Bent\nBoth managers have to settle for the draw as valiant efforts from both sides werent enough to bring out a final winner but a controversially disallowed goal takes the headlines A Darren Bent double wasnt enough to see Aston Villa of the relegation zone as a Leighton Baines penalty saves the day for Everton The games firsthalf was definitely a counterattacking affair with both sides looking to open the scoring on the break with Everton most certainly the brighter of the two Both teams were showing a mix of determination and energy despite the midweek internationals and were putting on a good show for the spectators at Goodison The hosts took lead after tremendous running and footwork by midfielder Leon Osman saw the Toffees secure a firsthalf advantage However it didnt last long with Darren Bent getting two goals in the secondhalf the second coming after a controversially disallowed goal from Jermaine Beckford that appeared to cross the line Leighton Baines had to save David Moyes blushes from the penalty spot to keep hopes alive of a tophalf finish The home side were without the prowess of French striker Louis Saha who will be facing the rest of the season on the sidelines after surgery on his ankle leaving Beckford to take the striking duties on his own Jack Rodwell and Tim Cahill were also ruled out through injury but youngster Seamus Coleman passed a late fitness test and started the game Villa were glad to see James Collins and Richard Dunne return to their defensive lineup however Ciaran Clark was still suspended Everton began the game in a positive manner putting on early pressure to show their intentions towards Gerard Houlliers side winning an early free kick around 20yards outside the Villa area John Heitinga stepped up to the setpiece but didnt even pass the Villa wall and the ball was cleared to safety Just minutes later Beckford was put on goal much to his surprise by a stray backheader that was meant for Brad Friedel However the former Leeds man couldnt get it past Villas American keeper and pushed the angled shot out for a corner The following set piece also tested the former Liverpool shot stopper after Leighton Baines swung in the ball eventually falling for Coleman whose effort was blasted straight down the middle of goal forcing Friedel to save with his feet Regardless of their own spirit within the game Villa were only able to threaten Tim Howards net through a succession of corners with Dunne going the closest with a header but the effort could only manage to past the outside of the keepers rightpost On his 10year anniversary for the Toffees Tony Hibbert was repaying the faith through a solid defensive display showcasing his experience with a shotstopping block on a Nigel ReoCoker effort ensuring that Everton would not be the first to go behind in what was becoming an endtoend battle The deadlock was finally broken after a nonstop 38 minutes with Osman putting the hosts ahead Working the ball down the left teammate Diniyar Bilyaletdinov allowed Osman to collect the ball in his stride Using a combination of pace and delicate footwork he was able to outmaneuver the Villa defenders and place the ball past Friedel enabling Everton to go in at halftime with a one goal lead However the Toffees lead didnt even last three minutes of the secondhalf Stewart Downing cutting inside the right channel allowed himself to find some space on the edge of the area and unchallenged was able to place the ball towards the penalty spot where a waiting and unmarked Darren Bent was able to power his foot through the pass causing the ball to fly into the top righthand corner of Howards net Howard didnt help Evertons cause after a moment of madness when the American came rushing out to challenge Bent but the keeper could only manage to foul the England international The resulting setpiece could have led to an immediate second for Villa if Kyle Walker had kept his volleyed effort from inside the area down Just a few minutes later Everton found themselves asking why they hadnt regained the lead after a corner from the right found an unmarked Heitinga leaving the Dutchman with a free header on goal but Friedel found some inspiring luck to save the shot with his own head Osman tried to follow up the effort however his contribution wasnt so accurate and drifted wide of the net Football showed its how punishing it could be after Beckford was out through on goal for Everton and deciding to shoot from just inside the box the ball smacked against the woodwork and appeared to cross the line However didnt see it that way nor did his assistants Friedels following goal kick was quickly taken and through a succession of rapid passing Bent was through on goal at the other end and the former Sunderland man was able to trickle the ball past Howard to put Villa 21 up amidst a shadow of controversy David Moyes team was saved from taking nothing away from a game they had put so much effort into after John Ill Makoun brought down Phill Jagielka just inside the box following a spirited run from the England centerhalf Baines stood up to the spot to take the equalizing chance and did so in clinical fashion powering the ball past Friedel A flurry of chances at the end for Everton couldnt help them take all the points from the game a succession of corners tested Friedel until the end but to no avail and both managers had to settle for the draw For more on Americans abroad visit Goalcoms

aS'India beats Sri Lanka to win cricket World Cup\nMUMBAI India AP  India won crickets World Cup for the first time in 28 years Saturday with a sixwicket victory at home over Sri Lanka The result touched off wild celebrations across India and gave the great Sachin Tendulkar his first title in six attempts Tendulkar the greatest batsman in cricket was lifted onto his teammates shoulders for a victory lap at Wankhede Stadium Its the ultimate thing and Im experiencing it he said I couldnt have asked for anything better Its the proudest moment of my life Tendulkar was out for 18 unable to produce his 100th international century on his home ground Still his teammates dedicated the victory to him He carried the hopes of the nation for 21 years so its time we carried him on our shoulders batsman Virat Kohli said Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni scored an unbeaten 91 sharing a 109run stand with Gautam Gambhir 97 and finishing with a giant six India chased down Sri Lanka 2746 and became the first team to win batting second in a final since Sri Lanka beat Australia by eight wickets in 1996 Australia won the three previous World Cups  1999 2003 and 2007 The 37yearold Tendulkar the leading run scorer in international cricket praised those around him Its never too late as they say Thanks to all my teammates Without such fabulous performance and such consistency it would never have happened he said adding he was brought to tears They were happy tears so I wouldnt mind crying Tendulkar was drenched in champagne by his teammates as the Indian squad carried the trophy around the stadium amid a scrum of cameras and fireworks blazing from the roof There was traffic chaos on the adjoining Marine Parade with the road jammed with cars and motor bikes honking horns waving Indian flags and letting off firecrackers Yuvraj Singh who scored an unbeaten 21 in an unbroken fifthwicket partnership with Dhoni was voted player of the series This is unbelievable This is the most special one for whole of India for Sachin for the whole team Its just amazing We batted like champions Sangakkara said he was proud of the way his Sri Lankans pushed the tournament favorites to the limit in the closest final since 1992 Im very proud of everyone especially Mahela Jayawardene who rose to the occasion with a great hundred he said Its been a great tournament for us I must say the way India played they really deserved the tag of favorites There was no winning farewell to international cricket for Muttiah Muralitharan the only survivor from Sri Lankas 1996 winning squad Muralitharan the leading wicket taker in international cricket was slowed by injuries He did not have the spring he needs for the extra spin that has bamboozled batsmen for a generation The result also made Mahela Jayawardene the first batsmen to score a century in a World Cup final and end up on a losing team The match tilted twice with India on top at the start before some late hitting led by Jayawardene Lasith Malinga removed both Indian openers in an express pace opening spell to keep the visitors on track but Indias long batting lineup remained calm enough to keep grinding the target down Jayawardene finished in a tie for the leading wicket taker in the tournament with 21 However his last figures of 260 after his first five overs cost him just six runs The Sri Lankans scored 63 runs in the last five overs in a batting power play including 24 in the last nine balls The match started amid confusion when the referee ordered a second coin toss because he couldnt hear Sangakkaras call Sangakkara won the second toss a rarity in the international game and was relieved to be batting first '

aS'Manchester Uniteds Wayne Rooney apologises for swearing outburst after hattrick goal against West Ham\nWayne Rooneys hattrick inspired another impressive Manchester United comeback at West Ham although the striker was forced to apologise after swearing down a television camera after scoring his third goal United swept back from 20 down at halftime to beat West Ham 42 going seven points clear at the top of the table Rooney scored the first with a freekick finished crisply for the second and converted a penalty for his hattrick Javier Hernandez on as a substitute added the fourth We played like champions said Sir Alex Ferguson We didnt lose faith in ability and that was important It is not an easy place to come here with them fighting relegation and at 20 down we were under the cosh It was a real championship performance Ferguson conceded that Nemanja Vidic had enjoyed a lucky break when he was shown just a yellow card in the first half for pulling back Demba Ba when the last defender but took issue with Lee Masons award of the second penalty against United It was outside the box he said While Rooney delivered a superb performance his celebration of the third goal when he was clearly picked up shouting   off by the pitchside camera caused considerable embarrassment to the broadcasters who apologised to viewers immediately Rooney also said sorry for the outburst which came just days after Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore had demanded that the Respect campaign was better observed He said I want to apologise for any offence that may have been caused especially any parents or children watching Emotions were running high and on reflection my heatofthemoment reaction was inappropriate It was not aimed at anyone in particular An FA spokesman confirmed the governing body would look at the incident Rooney could be charged with bringing the game into disrepute although that is unlikely It is not the firsttime Rooney has got in trouble with pitchside cameras After Englands 00 draw with Algeria in last years World Cup he directed a foulmouthed tirade into a camera at fans who were booing the team off the pitch '

aS'West Ham 2 Man United 4 Rooney bags a hattrick leaves title in sight\nWayne Rooney delivered the sort of hattrick which marks him out as one of the few extraordinary footballing talents this country possesses yet few could have seen it coming The Manchester United striker was not playing particularly well before the pivotal 63rd minute of this game and neither were his teammates even if West Hams twogoal lead did flatter the east London club What then transpired in a 15minute spell demonstrated all of Rooneys considerable qualities Perhaps inevitably he went on to sully it with his expletive into a TV camera But while his capacity to be a role model will always be dubious at best his football ability is less in doubt Uniteds title challenge was faltering here yesterday Trailing to two penalties they looked unconvincing even against a distinctly shaky West Ham side Indeed even if United go on to glory it will be difficult to escape the conclusion that they would be the least inspiring of Sir Alex Fergusons 12 Premier League title teams However in terms of sheer belligerence and indefatigability they are unsurpassed Going for it is important to our club and we played like champions said Ferguson We kept our heads up and we didnt lose faith in our ability He was right of course This United side have no concept of being beaten even on a day when Nemanja Vidic was doing his utmost to remove himself from the shortlists for playeroftheseason awards his lax positioning and state of seemingly permanent panic infecting Chris Smalling and Patrice Evra Only when a bright new leftback prospect was introduced at halftime in place of Evra did Uniteds defence steady His name Ryan Giggs Once we polish him up a bit hell be OK joked Ferguson In fact asked to play a new position at 37 Giggs performed so well he might consider adding a few seasons to his career as a defender As for West Ham they will take heart from a wellexecuted start to the game rather than the abject surrender by the finish You dont count on a win against Manchester United even if we wanted to win it said manager Avram Grant The other games are more important Despite starting brightly with Smalling heading over after four minutes United capitulated in unusual fashion When Scott Parker launched a hopeful long ball on 11 minutes every schoolboy could have told Vidic and Smalling that it should have been met with a firm clearing header Instead it bounced and Carlton Cole flicked the ball up against Evras hand Referee Lee Mason pointed to the appropriate spot and Mark Noble dispatched the penalty confidently low to his left In 25 minutes was invited to try again Cole displaying uncommon confidence sold a dummy and raced past Vidic only to be felled by the Serbia defender The first foul was just outside the area but so marginal that it was difficult for anyone but Vidic to berate the referee Noble stepped up and this time went high and right Uniteds season was in jeopardy Despite Rob Green having to parry away a JiSung Park shot West Ham had found their stride Thomas Hitzlsperger sliced wide before Vidic failed to deal with yet another long ball on 42 minutes As Demba Ba wriggled away the defender wrestled him to the ground A yellow card was produced presumably because the ball was bouncing towards Tomasz Kuszczak standing in for groin strain victim Edwin van der Sar Vidic survived that potential sendingoff but when he felled Ba on 49 minutes a second yellow seemed inevitable It never came Even when Rooney lined up a freekick on the edge of the area on 63 minutes there had been little indication as to where the inspiration for a United comeback might come from But it would have been difficult to strike the shot any better  just above the wall and high into the top righthand corner  and as the ball struck the net the premature optimism of Upton Park deflated instantaneously On 72 minutes Antonio Valencias ball found Rooney and with his first touch he took out a posse of defenders with his second he lashed it into the net Now there was no doubt about where this game was going Fabio da Silva flicked the ball past Frederic Piquionne on 78 minutes and avoided an illadvised lunge from Matthew Upson who then handled Fabios pass from the touchline Rooneys penalty found the corner and he embarked on his illjudged celebration There was still time for Javier Hernandez to bolster his burgeoning reputation with a goal from close range on 84 minutes from a deflected Giggs cross '

aS'Fiverun rally carries Cubs to win\nCHICAGO AP Blake DeWitt came to Chicago Cubs spring training expecting to play a lot at second base During those six weeks in Arizona he pretty much played himself out of a job After hitting just 186 during the spring hes got new duties now parttime player utility man and pinchhitter On Saturday he delivered as that pinchhitter blasting a tworun twoout basesloaded double to cap a fiverun eighth inning and send the Cubs past the Pittsburgh Pirates 53 Whatever is asked of me Just keep playing and working DeWitt said Its new to me Ive had several pinchhit opportunities in my career Im not going to say a lot Ive done it before so I have a decent idea of how to get ready Chicagos comeback against relievers Evan Meek and Chris Resop was aided by a costly error on Pirates first baseman Lyle Overbay that made three of Chicagos runs in the eighth unearned We finally put an inning together Good for Blake DeWitt its a huge hit for him and for us said Cubs manager Mike Quade who got his first win as a fulltime skipper Cubs starter Carlos Zambrano left the game in the seventh with cramping in his right hand one batter after hed given up a leadoff homer to Garrett Jones that gave the Pirates a 30 lead Just a cramp but Ill be OK Drink a lot of fluids and do what I have to do said Zambrano whos had cramping issues previously in his career Zambrano said he began to cramp in his hamstring as he ran to the mound to start the seventh After giving up the homer Zambrano had a 22 count on Ronny Cedeno but couldnt continue Sean Marshall 10 got the victory with a scoreless eighth and Carlos Marmol pitched the ninth for his first save Pirates starter Paul Maholm pitched 6 23 shutout innings giving up five hits before the Cubs got to the Pirates bullpen We had the game and let it get away from us But you know what Ill hand the ball to Meek every time and all those guys in the bullpen Everybody is going to have bad outings Maholm said Chicago finally broke through as Meek 01 walked pinchhitter Kosuke Fukudome and threw a wild pitch before Starlin Castro hit an RBI double to make it 31 Overbay then misplayed Marlon Byrds grounder for an error as Castro scored to make it 32 Geovany Soto had a oneout single and Alfonso Soriano singled to rightcenter on a 12 pitch to tie it at 3 Resop relieved and walked Tyler Colvin to load the bases Dewitt then doubled to left as Wrigley Field erupted With the bases loaded you know hes got to come at you with strikes DeWitt said I put a good swing on it and came through After losing the opener to the Pirates 63 when they let a 20 lead slip away the Cubs were comforted by a comeback of their own You fall behind 30 and with the loss yesterday you get behind late in the game like that you can roll over and quit or keep battling DeWitt said It definitely helps create an identity to this ball club that were going to give it all for nine innings And thats what happened Meek trying to set it up for hardthrowing closer Joel Hanrahan took the blame When you go out there and walk the leadoff guy its never a good sign I just didnt make good pitches when I needed to Didnt make very smart pitches not smart locations Meek said I go out there every day expecting to get three outs and get them quickly  Its a very confident feeling so going out there and not doing my job and not making the pitches walking the leadoff guy that weighs on you hard Your team got three runs on the board your starter did a great job and youre expected to get three outs It just wasnt a good day for me Zambrano was put on a suspended list last June the day after he went on a rampage in the dugout at US Cellular Field He eventually underwent anger management counseling and when he rejoined the team he found his groove and went 80 over his final 11 starts Zambrano who threw 99 pitches on a cool 46degree day gave up five hits and three runs in his six innings plus Zambrano walked two in the top of the first before Pedro Alvarez pulled a twoout RBI single to right to give the Pirates an early 10 lead Neil Walker whod hit a grand slam in Pittsburghs 63 seasonopening victory Friday had an RBI double in the third after Jose Tabata reached on an infield single After Andrew McCutchen walked to put runners at first and second with no outs Zambrano averted a big inning He struck out Overbay and then raced to cover first and complete a double play that was started by first baseman Carlos Pena on Alvarezs brokenbat grounder Maholm retired the first eight batters before Zambrano drove a double NOTES It was five degrees warmer than Friday and was accompanied by a 12mph wind blowing left to right The crowd was much smaller announced at 35782 compared to 41358 a day earlier  Matt Garza who will make his Cubs debut Sunday spent most of Saturday leading cheers on the dugout steps while wearing sunglasses and a sweat shirt  Jones had a quick start last season when he hit two homers in

aS'India cricketers complete epic journey in exultant Mumbai\nMUMBAI Reuters  India completed an epic journey beginning in Dhaka 43 days ago and culminating in a sixwicket victory over Sri Lanka on Saturday after they had appeared to be down and out in the World Cup final Two thunderbolts from Lasith Malinga accounted for Virender Sehwag 0 and Sachin Tendulkar 18 after India set out in pursuit of a challenging target of 275 Only two sides had previously won the trophy batting second and a crowd of 33000 at the Wankhede Stadium sat in stunned silence after Tendulkar edged a catch to a jubilant Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara behind the stumps Tendulkar had scored centuries against England and South Africa to take his tally of international centuries to 99 and all Mumbai had been willing him to score the 100th in his native town Malinga had other ideas after an assured start by Tendulkar who at the age of 37 is unlikely to play in another World Cup But Tendulkar the ultimate team man was just happy to be part of a winning outfit at his sixth World Cup and he was carried on the shoulders of his team mates around the ground after the best final since Pakistan beat England in 1992 Hes carried the burden of the nation for 21 years so its time we carried him on our shoulders said Virat Kohli summing up the feelings of a billion of his compatriots In a reminder if it were needed that no individual is bigger than the team Tendulkars early exit gave an opportunity to Gautam Gambhir and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take their side to victory India became the first nation to win the event on home soil TWOYEAR TARGET Gambhir scored an assured 97 while Dhoni who had looked leadenfooted throughout the tournament recaptured his form to score an unbeaten 91 finishing the game with a theatrical six Sri Lankas 274 for six after Sangakkara had won the toss was largely the result of a masterly 103 not out from Mahela Jayawardene But after Malingas opening burst Sri Lankas decision to drop spinners Ajantha Mendis and Rangana Herath backfired and Sangakkara always seemed a bowler short Muttiah Muralitharan determined to bring the trophy to Sri Lanka for a second time did his best to overcome the effects of a hamstring and a knee injury in his final international match Although the competitive fires still burned bright he was understandably tentative in his runup the ball did not spit and turn as it once did and he failed to add to his record of 534 oneday wickets Dhoni who joins Kapil Dev as the only two Indian captains to lift the World Cup said the team had set their sights on the World Cup 18 months to two years ago Whatever we were doing on the field we had a longterm goal he said Just by having a target in mind doesnt mean you will win the World Cup We prepared well for the World Cup we tried to keep each and every individual fit We tried to keep the best XI in the best form We peaked at the right time we wanted to win it for each other Yuvraj Singh was named as the manofthetournament after his consistency with the bat and his invaluable contribution with his leftarm spin This is unbelievable he said Tonight is going to be good night Thank you India '

aS'Google to limit carriers Android flexibility Good\nGoogle has finally gotten fed up with the humiliating alterations its Android operating system has been subjected to by wireless carriers So says a Bloomberg Businessweek story by Ashlee Vance and Peter Burrows that reports on a new set of rules Google will enforce on mobile partners who want the equivalent of mostfavorednation status There will be no more willynilly tweaks to the software No more partnerships formed outside of Googles purview From now on companies hoping to receive early access to Googles most uptodate software will need approval of their plans The story reported that the Mountain View Calif company was requiring that other firms licensing its Linuxbased operating system sign nonfragmentation clauses to grant it veto power over their tweaks to the operating system Having seen many of these tweaks  from harmless but sometimes unappreciated alterations such as Samsung and HTCs TouchWiz and Sense overlays to outright mutilations of Android such as Verizons excruciating Samsung Fascinate which hardwired its search button to Microsofts Bing  I have no problem with Googles change of heart The users I hear from dont want any more extras from those companies As Windows PC buyers have said for years they want to be able to choose a clean uncluttered configuration of the standard operating system Thats what I loved about the Nexus S phone I reviewed late last year And thats why some Android users myself included have taken the radical step of installing a thirdparty build of Android to replace the limited carrierinstalled version This is a risk I worried about when Google announced Android My column at the time emphasized the benefits of Androids openness to users but fretted that carriers could always choose to revise it to lock out any tinkering by their customers Its true that Google promised something different at Androids launch Its Nov 5 2007 press release states that the Android platform will be made available under one of the most progressive developerfriendly opensource licenses which gives mobile operators and device manufacturers significant freedom and flexibility to design products But Google has always had one constraint on the carriers access to its Android Market Until now its been extraordinarily lenient with that authority even allowing them to replace such core Android programs as its browser calendar and contacts applications with their own Manufacturers can opt out of the Android Market resulting in such oddities as the noname Android tablets that arrived in stores last fall with older versions of the operating system and no easy way to install addon software It cannot possibly be a surprise if Google now moves to exploit that limited leverage to fix problems with its product So why the vitriol over this move In a scathing post linking to a Businessweek story influential tech blogger John Gruber labeled Googles change in strategy the Android baitandswitch laid bare and called Android manager Andy Rubin engineering vice president Vic Gundotra and departing chief executive Eric Schmidt shameless lying hypocrites Well then I understand the annoyance at a company professing a dont be evil motto in the way that some people gripe about Apples bouts of sanctimoniousness But just like Apple Google is a publiclytraded forprofit corporation  not a monastery a think tank or a nonprofit like Mozilla For that matter many opensource licenses enforce some limits on what you can do with the code in question Its rarely a freeforall I dont need conspiracy theories here I find it a lot easier to think that Google not for the first time didnt grasp what sort of companies it was dealing with when it waltzed into this market Remember these are the people who had no apparent idea that Google TV would get blocked from the Web sites of major TV networks If its now acting like a redblooded capitalist instead of a software evangelist  fine Cracking down on carriers who want early access to the Android source code seems not an injustice but the only rational response for Google if it wants to keep Androids quality Save your outrage if Google stops releasing Android source code at all  for example if the current hold in releasing the source for the Honeycomb tabletoptimized version of Android never ends  or if it follows the practice of ATT and blocks you from installing Android programs outside of the Android Market But unless you believe in a cartoon vision of open when it comes to mobilephone software theres little cause to protest Googles move and more than a few reasons to support it '

aS'4 Reasons Why ThunderBolt Could Be Outselling Verizons iPhone\nThe HTC ThunderBolt is reportedly outselling Apples iPhone 4 in some Verizon locations if one analyst firm is correct BGR shares the information from BTIG Research which has called more than 150 Verizon stores to gather sales data Nearly twothirds of the stores indicated sales are neckandneck between the two devices while 28 percent reported the ThunderBolt is proving more popular than the iPhone Without actual sales numbers from either Verizon or Apple theres no way to verify the analyst claims but there are four logical reasons why they might be true The next iPhone While many Verizon customers waited more than 35 years to see an iPhone for their network of choice its difficult to imagine that all who waited actually bought the Verizon iPhone when it came out Why Apples annual refresh cycle for the iPhone is nearly common knowledge to the masses and would be wellknown to any Verizon customer whos been waiting for a CDMA iPhone since June of 2007 Theres no guarantee this June will see the next iPhone  there are even rumors of a September release  but after waiting 35 years it makes sense to wait a few more months in case Apple does follow the traditional iPhone refresh cycle with an updated model 4G is a huge differentiator The HTC ThunderBolt is the first and currently the only 4G handset able to use Verizons speedy LTE mobile broadband network Verizons iPhone is stuck on the older EVDO 3G network and although many factors influence network speeds a 3G Verizon iPhone surfs the web around 10 times slower than the HTC ThunderBolt in a 4G coverage area Verizon is also pushing the LTE capabilities by offering 4G data for the ThunderBolt at the same monthly price as the 3G data plan used by the iPhone And the operator is throwing in personal hotspot function for free until May 15 on the ThunderBolt Apple Stores are missing from the equation Heres a fly in the ointment for those thinking the BTIG data can be applied to overall handset sales You cant assume that the ThunderBolt is selling better than the iPhone overall on Verizons network because the data doesnt include sales figures or estimates from Apple Stores Again without any hard sales data from Apple or Verizon we dont know how the newest iPhone is selling but to assume all Verizon iPhones are sold in Verizon stores would be ludicrous Bigger is better This line of thought gets into the debate I had with Darrell Etherington last month I still subscribe to the idea that consumers are intrigued by larger displays on smartphones which are still highly pocketable Yes the 960640 resolution on the iPhone 4 is stellar but the 800480 resolution on the ThunderBolts 43inch screen is quite nice and the keyboard is less cramped due to the extra room Yet the larger screen doesnt boost the device size that much over the iPhone 4 Apples handset measures 45 x 23 x 04 while the ThunderBolt comes in a 48 x 26 x 05 in size Either way the situation is a winwin for Verizon and its customers Those who want a Verizon iPhone now have the option after years of making do with alternative handsets or carriers And people who prefer Android andor want to surf on Verizons LTE network can do so with the ThunderBolt A truer comparison between the iPhone and competing Android handsets on Verizon starts with Apples next handset especially if it has LTE capabilities as several new Android phones are expected to have in the next few months Until then  or until we see actual Verizon iPhone sales figures  the ThunderBolt appears to be having a good run against the iPhone and for good reasons Related content from GigaOM Pro subscription reqd In Q3 the Tablet and 4G Were the Big Stories Mobile Operators Strategies for Connected Devices In Q4 Data Was Mobiles Hot Spot Copyright 2011 GigaOm All Rights Reserved GigaOm is an independent blog network Read More  '

aS'Larry Page set to take over as Google CEO starting Monday\nWhen Google GOOG cofounder Larry Page reclaims the role of CEO on Monday it will be business as usual at the Googleplex No formal ceremonies are planned There will be no speeches The absence of pomp underscores Pages focus on the job ahead  spurring Google to innovate faster as it battles Facebook and other competitors to react more like a nimble startup even as it zooms past 25000 employees As he takes the reins Pages aim appears to be to hone Googles sense of discipline to keep the companys management structure as flat as possible despite its growth and particularly to urge Googlers to continue to think big But there are also questions about whether Pages personality including his detachment and his past unwillingness to be the public face of Google will well serve a company facing a host of regulatory challenges To a large extent the culture of Google is what Larry wants it to be said Craig Silverstein who joined Page and cofounder Sergey Brin as the startups first employee in 1998 Google announced in January that Page Googles CEO from its incorporation in 1998 until Eric Schmidts arrival in 2001 would again become CEO as of April 4 Since then Page has made some subtle but interesting changes to how the company operates He has told Googlers to change how they run meetings to make them more focused and productive and he has directed executives to meet in public areas of the Googleplex so they will be more accessible to hearing ideas from rankandfile Googlers say people familiar with the changes Schmidt and cofounder Sergey Brin have been more in the public spotlight than the 38yearold son of a computer science professor from Michigan over the past decade But Page has remained a driving force within Google since 2001 insisting on reviewing every hire say people familiar with the company and continuing to push hyperambitious projects like the companys effort to scan every book ever published into a vast digital library Its certainly true that Eric is the public face but inside Google the founders are still very much the face of the company in many ways said Silverstein who spoke in an interview just after the Jan 20 announcement that Page would return to the CEO job with Schmidt becoming executive chairman Page has a foresight that few people have Silverstein said Page a was a driving force for the massive computing power Google needed to create long before many at Google saw the need for products like Google Instant  the feature the search giant introduced last year and that Yahoo YHOO recently imitated that begins to offers search results as soon as users type a letter into the query box Hell have an idea that seems really crazy that we should have enough computing power that we can do something like Google Instant long before we did it and everbody says Well have to spend billions on that and there will be all this pushback and hell hve none of it Silverstein said Paul Buchheit the former Googler who coined the phrase Dont Be Evil said Pages return sends a signal to Silicon Valley that innovation and taking risks for big ideas still matter at Google This notion that something being impossible doesnt really bother you thats really central to a lot of Googles big projects said Buchheit who created Gmail before leaving the company in 2006 When you look at them from the start they seem impossible  and that does not deter Page Buchheit said Its taking on things that might be possible or might be impossible but if they are possible it would have a really big impact on the world No one expects Page to be a standardissue CEO Those like Silverstein who know Page well say that while he isnt shy neither is he an extroverted halefellowwell met But he has also been described as brusque with people whose ideas he doesnt value and he has often shunned press attention Some Google watchers say Pages famous reticience and his skepticism of the value of external communication may not serve him well as CEO Brilliant engineers like Page are really good at things they can measure They have high a high IQ but often a low EQ or emotional quotient said Ken Auletta who spent two years inside the Googleplex reporting his book Googled The End of the World as We Know It Larry is not as talented at things he cant measure like why governments and citizens might fear Googles dominance or issues like privacy and copyright Page certainly is more aware of government and other outside concerns But they make him impatient Which is dangerous when youre wrestling with an 800pound government gorilla Page faces a full and complex plate of legal and regulatory issues when he takes on his new job Just this week the Federal Trade Commission forced Google into a 20year commitment to accept outside supervision on privacy and archrival Microsoft filed an antitrust complaint against Google in Europe A decision by the US Department of Justice on whether to block on antitrust grounds Googles 700 million purchase of ITA Software which makes the most heavily used airfare search software is expected soon On the day Google announced the change at the top Page said Ive learned a ton from Schmidt over the years He may need those new skills to deal with politicans and regulators in Washington and Brussels who are pushing for an increasing voice in Googles future Veteran tech analyst Rob Enderle who praised the reshuffling in January said he has become concerned since then that Page will not step up to the full requirements of the job which include being the human face of Google Google declined to make Page available for an interview Yardsticks like profit and revenue suggest Google has never been more successful and its Android smartphone software gives the company a powerful foothold in the emerging mobile web But Google stock is down 6 percent since the Jan 20 announcement that Page would replace Schmidt as CEO a period in which the NASDAQ is up 3 percent Its unclear how Googlers as a group view the change at the top but they dont seem to be cheering Schmidts departure The employment website Glassdoorcom released a study Friday saying Schmidt has a 96 percent approval rating from Googlers filing anonymous ratings of their CEO over the past 12 months an even higher rating than Apples AAPL Steve Jobs Buchheit always believed Pages return as CEO was inevitable and that Pages determination to swing for the fences is critical to Googles identity It was just a question of when it was going to happen Buchheit said of Pages return He was originally the CEO and the only reason that changed was because the VCs required it to change He has a lot of pretty strong opinions about how this thing should be run and hes stayed very involved in the company '

aS'Bye Bye Qwest and Hello Cloud\nThe merger between CenturyLink and Qwest officially closed today creating the nations thirdlargest phone company in a world where being a phone company means less and less To honor the occasion CenturyLink we lose the Qwest name offered to have Christopher Ancell president of business markets talk with me about what the future holds in his division which includes corporate telecommunications customers and those buying data center services The two big themes are that bandwidth demand is continuing to grow and that the new scale gained through this acquisition might help CenturyLink make some cloudrelated deals In the last year Qwest had tiptoed into the ondemand services market by providing application recovery and interactive voice recognition on demand but it wasnt as large a player as Verizon with its ComputeasaService products And in January Verizon said it would purchase Terremark a provider of private clouds and data centers in a deal valued at 14 billion saying cloud services were a big growth area for the company Ancell agrees although when I asked about the likelihood of a CenturyLink acquisition in this space he replied Glen Post is an acquirer and has been the CEO for 19 years and has a track record of acquiring companies and I would expect that to continue Ancell says the merger gives CenturyLink scale and larger free cash flow which could boost its dealmaking capabilities The company is trying to figure out what customers want from InfrastructureasaService providers and what they want as software Qwest had 17 data centers that it brings to CenturyLink which as of the end of 2010 reported 17294 million in cash and 2 billion in operating free cash flow It does have more than 7 billion in debt however and none of that includes Qwests contribution Aside from a possible rush to the cloud CenturyLink closes this deal with 190000 miles of fiber after adding 75000 miles of Qwest local fiber and 30000 miles of Qwest backbone fiber As it seeks to serve businesses and data centers the biggest constant is bandwidth demand continuing to grow Ancell echoed what I had heard recently about larger corporations wanting to upgrade to 100 Gigabit access from 10 Gigabit pipes  completely skipping over the 40 Gigabit access He cautioned that not everyone was skipping 40 Gigabit access but that the awesome demand for video and other applications was causing companies to look hard at their upgrades With 40 percent of network traffic being video the demand is continuing to rise he said People just need more and more bandwidth at rates that almost have us saying What is going onAncell said Image courtesy of Flickr user Torkildr Related content from GigaOM Pro subscription reqd Verizon Buys Terremark and Rackspace Looks Even Better Mobile Operators Strategies for Connected Devices Report Delivering Content in the Cloud Copyright 2011 GigaOm All Rights Reserved GigaOm is an independent blog network Read More  '

aS'Google founder hopes to prove hes ready to lead\nLarry Page takes over as CEO Mon replacing Eric Schmidt a veteran Silicon Valley executive AP SAN FRANCISCO  Google cofounder Larry Page is known for his vision passion and intelligence Yet there is a fair amount of concern that Pages other known traits  his aloofness rebellious streak and affinity for pursuing wacky ideas  might lead the company astray Page takes over as CEO on Monday as fastrising rivals and tougher regulators threaten Googles growth Investors used to Google Incs consistency in exceeding financial targets worry that new leadership will bring more emphasis on longterm projects that take years to pay off And many people still arent sure he has enough management skills to steer the Internets most powerful company Page already has learned that smarts alone wont make him a great leader Although Page impressed Googles early investors with his ingenuity they still insisted that he step down in 2001 as Googles first CEO He turned over the job to Eric Schmidt a veteran executive who began working in Silicon Valley in the early 1980s while Page was still in grammar school Gmail Motion Googles revolutionary new technology Pages admirers say that at 38 he is more mature and less apt to be chronically late to meetings or tune out of conversations that dont stimulate his intellect  habits that he fell into during his first stint as CEO There are parts of being CEO that dont fit Larrys personality said Craig Silverstein the first employee that Page and Googles other founder Sergey Brin hired when they started the company in 1998 You wear a lot of different hats when youre CEO Some of them are very interesting to Larry and some of them presumably are less interesting True to his taciturn form Page hasnt said much publicly since Google made its stunning announcement in January that he will replace Schmidt as CEO Google said Page wasnt available for an interview Page though has left little doubt about his top priority to dissolve the bureaucracy and complacency that accompanied the companys rapid transformation into a 21stcentury empire Google is expected to end the year with more than 30000 employees and 35 billion in annual revenue In Pages mind the 13yearold company needs to return to thinking and acting like a feisty startup Rising Internet stars such as Facebook Twitter and Groupon all less than 8 years old are developing products that could challenge Google and make its dominance of Internet search less lucrative Page has drawn comparisons to two hightech geniuses who are even more accomplished Microsoft Corp cofounder Bill Gates and Apple Inc cofounder Steve Jobs Like those two pioneers in personal technology Page invented and cultivated a product that changed the world But Page has yet to match them in this respect as CEOs Gates and Jobs brought out the best in the companies that they created delighting stockholders as their investments soared Page doesnt fit the CEO mold even by the standards of Silicon Valleys freewheeling culture He dropped out of graduate school at Stanford to start Google and doesnt have a business degree Science and technology though seems to be in his DNA even though he grew up in Michigan where automobiles rule His late father Carl was a computer scientist and pioneer in artificial intelligence and his mother taught computer programming Page began working on personal computers when he was just 6 years old in 1979 when home computers were a rarity The geeky impulses carried into his adulthood leading him to once build an inkjet printer out of Legos Page relishes challenging the status quo and encourages his employees to do so too Those who know Page suspect he picked up the antiestablishment mindset as a boy who attended Montessori schools which discourage structured curricula and encourage independent activities Page has wanted to control his own destiny  and legacy  since reading a biography of the inventor Nikola Tesla before he was even in high school Tesla wasnt rewarded or widely recognized for his breakthroughs in Xray wireless communications and electricity Page didnt want that to happen to him as an entrepreneur For that reason Page embraced the chance to be Googles CEO when the company started in a rented garage not far from the companys current headquarters in Mountain View Calif It also helps explain why he and Brin created a separate class of stock with greater voting power so they and Schmidt could remain in charge after the company went public in 2004 Pages stake in Google has made him one of the worlds wealthiest people with an estimated fortune of 20 billion Although the contours of his personality and background are known quantities Page remains an enigmatic figure on Wall Street To some he remains best known for uncompromising idealism reflected in his embrace of his companys Dont Be Evil motto and his pledge to never cater to investors desire for everrising quarterly earnings at the expense of longterm investments Page already raised concerns by pushing Google into renewable energy and robotic cars Those who know him say he has discussed even more farflung projects behind closed doors Sometimes his ideas are just way out there and youre kind of like Wow that came out of left field said Ethan Anderson a former Google product manager who now runs Redbeacon a startup that operates a search engine for finding neighborhood businesses Uncertainty about whether Page will be as interested as Schmidt in appeasing Wall Street has contributed to a 6 percent drop in Googles stock price since the CEO change was announced Jan 20 The technologydriven Nasdaq index has added 3 percent during that time BGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis doesnt believe its a coincidence that Google revealed it would hire more than 6200 employees this year  a 25 percent boost and the most in its history  less than a week after it announced Pages comeback as CEO Dont be surprised if Googles spending goes up even it means its earnings per share might go down Gillis said Pages supporters believe Googles current market value of about 190 billion will climb even higher under his leadership That would mirror what happened after Jobs finally got his chance to run Apple in 1997 after a decade in exile Since then Apple has brought out the iconic iPod iPhone and iPad devices and created more than 300 billion in shareholder wealth But the returns of company founders havent always been triumphant Consider Yahoo Inc cofounder Jerry Yangs second stint as CEO from June 2007 to January 2009 Yahoos stock fell 56 percent during that period larger than the 41 percent drop for Nasdaq Unlike the rest of the Nasdaq Yahoo shares arent close to rebounding to their June 2007 levels Hoping to smooth the transition to a new CEO Google is keeping Schmidt 55 in a prominent role as executive chairman and chief liaison with lawmakers and regulators around the world Thats an important job as Google faces growing scrutiny over its ambitions to use its dominance in search to enter new markets Brin 37 intends to focus on longterm projects leaving Page to manage Googles daily operations I am quite convinced that this change will result in faster decisionmaking better success for the business and ultimately greater value for the shareholders Schmidt told The Associated Press after Google announced its shakeup in January In the past the three made key decisions by committee though Schmidt was the one responsible as CEO Schmidt guided Google through an uninterrupted stretch of prosperity that has topped the performances of other technology trailblazers including Apple and Microsoft at similar stages of their corporate lives Page is better prepared to be CEO after a decade as Schmidts apprentice said Douglas Merrill who worked with both executives before leaving Google in 2008 as vice president of engineering Larry has grown over time Merrill said He has learned how to make projects work He has learned how to make sure things happen on time and in a predictable fashion Larry is a sort of a learning machine '

aS'Why Google is getting into the Like business\nComputerworld  Google announced this week a new social search feature called 1 The new offering competes in some ways with Facebooks Like button By clicking on an optional new 1 button on your Google search results you can tell family and friends that you recommend certain links Big deal right Well actually it could soon be a very big deal What Googles 1 adds up to Googles 1 isnt what Google would call a shipping product Its a Labs experiment a cross between a beta program and a trial balloon But its available to everyone and easy to use You just go to the Google Labs page and click Join this experiment in the section about 1 Once youve done that when youre searching on Google youll see a 1 button on every search All your 1 recommendations are retained on a new tab viewable on your Google Profile You can choose to make them public or keep them private Ive made mine public  you can check my 1s here Also When your Google contacts conduct searches of their own that bring back links youve flagged with 1 theyll see your recommendation on the results page For now the feature is limited to Google Search Google plans to roll out the feature for websites of all kinds including blogs Google also says it plans to record information about your 1 activity in order to provide you and other users with a better experience on Google services That could mean just about anything although Google says 1 activity does not affect search rankings How 1 is like and unlike Like Once Google offers the ability for website owners to add 1 buttons on their sites the service will be a lot like Facebooks Like feature With Facebook everything you Like anywhere on the Web is viewable by friends on Facebook And thats one of the differences With 1 your recommendations are currently unlikely to be encountered in the wild by contacts It requires both optin by contacts plus the unlikely event that the other person searches for something youve already flagged Google 1 is currently useful only for seeing someones preferences after youve run across them on your own while Facebook Like is better for discovery Both could be a lot better for discovery Whats missing from both Googles and Facebooks recommendation engines is the ability to pool all that data in a single space The ultimate application would be open APIs by both parties with some scrappy startup building the ultimate Digg replacement site where both systems are combined into a single popularity contest for content One advantage of 1 over Like is that it lets you recommend things without appearing to approve of them When I encounter a blog post headlined Tickets for Apples Developer Event Selling for 3500 on eBay and click the Facebook Like button it appears on my Wall above the phrase Mike Elgan Likes this It makes me look like a sociopath Googles 1 is more neutral Google currently has two incompatible systems You can click 1 on search But on Buzz where the 1 could really find some use Google uses the word Like in a system thats disconnected from the 1 recommendations This is especially awkward because Google went to great pains to connect Profiles and Buzz But 1 recommendations show up in Profiles and Likes remain in Buzz Its a fractured mess Meanwhile Facebooks Like system is unified Why 1 and Like matter Social recommendation tools like 1 and Like can potentially help users do things such as the following  Get and give recommendations to friends replacing link sharing  Bring attention to cool stuff replacing or enhancing Digg and Reddit  Bookmark and remember things replacing browser bookmarks Instapaper and StumbleUpon  Set up popularity polls replacing poll plugins on blogs  Engage in social science research replacing textbased voting on American Idol  The exciting thing about the Likebutton concept is that it can and probably will spill over into the real world Within a few years youll probably be able to Like TV shows locations via existing locationbased services like Foursquare Google Latitude or Facebook Places Smartphone appbased services are getting better and better at recognizing songs and TV shows by the sound and soon theyll be able to recognize objects that you photograph with the camera in your phone So youll be able to Like all kinds of content and objects in the real world Googles 1 system is new and experimental and therefore isnt changing the world yet Facebooks Like system is becoming influential but its still overshadowed by Twitter link sharing and other ways of sharing and recommending content The reason this is a big deal is this History tells us that obscure trivial services like Twitter and Facebook and even Google itself can rise to dominate user attention and make billions for the entrepreneurs who get it right Whoever dominates Liketype services could end up making enormous amounts of money The whole Like idea is potentially superior to link sharing bookmarking social bookmarking polling and other technologies that millions of people use every day If the concept really takes hold it could become the primary way for people to share content links opinions and much more And dont even get me started on the marketing potential Once companies get us to start Liking and recommending the products and services we buy theyll have found a lucrative enhancement to advertising and marketing campaigns Google 1 Facebook Like or some other service we dont know about yet could one day rise to dominate the lucrative new world of social influence Mike

aS'Music Industry Will Force Licenses on Amazon Cloud Player mdash or Else\nAmazons decision to launch its new Cloud Player without securing additional music licenses has been described as a bold move by many observers It takes serious guts for Amazon to simply declare that it doesnt need licenses  especially when even casual observers know the music industry thinks otherwise Still this isnt a onedimensional issue and the law has yet to deal much with services like Amazons Record companies fantasize about huge revenues from streaming services and they fear digital lockers like the plague The word streaming and the word download are nowhere in copyright law  MP3tunes CEO Michael Robertson If the record labels dont come to a licensing agreement with Amazon soon they will either be forced to take legal action or implicitly allow other music companies to ditch cloud licenses too Amazon vs the music industry Amazon launched two new services Cloud Drive and Cloud Player earlier this week US Amazon customers can get free online storage from Amazon to use for whatever they please but users are heavily encouraged to upload their local music libraries All Amazon MP3 purchases are automatically synced to the users Cloud Drive without counting against the quota too Once the music is copied to the remote drive users can then use the Cloud Player Android or Web app to stream the music to any compatible device or browser even if the files themselves had not been synced there Both Apple and Google are expected to launch very similar services in the future but neither has made an announcement Googles music service is rumored to offer both music downloads and streams to go with its own digital locker  the service would scan a users computer and automatically add any tracks that Google has licensed to that users online locker Apples may involve unlimited music redownloads and streams to iOS devices as part of a MobileMe revamp and Apple is currently believed to be in talks with the Big Four music labels  Sony Music Universal Music Group UMG Warner Music Group WMG and EMI  to make it happen If Apple and Google are dutifully trying to hammer out licensing deals why did Amazon go ahead and launch Cloud Player without them Amazon argues that Cloud Drive and Cloud Player are just services that let users upload and play back their own music just like any number of existing media management applications After all licenses shouldnt be necessary for users to play their own music right The labels seem to disagree  they expressed shock following Amazons announcement with a Sony Music representative implying that the company was looking into legal options But are licenses required for users to play back music that they have legally purchased even if that playback is coming from the cloud Continue reading  '

aS'Facebook comments prompt parents to remove children from teachers class\nPaterson parents converged on an elementary school this week demanding that their children be pulled from a class taught by a teacher who allegedly described herself as a warden overseeing future criminals on her Facebook page District officials suspended the firstgrade teacher at School 21 in an attempt to quell outrage that nonetheless continued Friday District officials confirmed the teacher identified by several sources as Jennifer Schmid OBrien has been suspended with pay and that an investigation into the comments is under way Theodore Best the school board president said a significant number of parents having seen the posts Wednesday arrived at the school to remove their children from her class On Friday parents retrieving children at dismissal said they were dumbfounded angered and disheartened by the comments and believed the teacher was unfit to remain in the classroom Some children exiting the school didnt believe it and thought it was an April Fools joke Vickie L WhiteFranklin who said Friday that her daughter ChaRashje Franklin 7 is in OBriens class heard the news earlier in the week Our children were disturbed by those comments she said They will grow up thinking theyve already been labeled as a criminal Heartbreaking Parents called the alleged comments shocking unprofessional hurtful and racist Some said she should teach elsewhere if shes unhappy while others recommended she be fired and her teaching certificate revoked Its heartbreaking said Angela Elliott a parent It makes me sad because I put trust in these teachers Theyre a part of my kids future Kesha Hopkins who went to School 21 and grew up nearby was dropping a cake off at the school Friday for her thirdgrade sons birthday party While there are worse parts of the city she said a person like that shouldnt be teaching in this area  an urban area Best said the teacher was suspended because reaction to the comments created serious problems at the school that impeded the functioning of the building The board president and other board members were informed of the incident in an emergency executive session Thursday You cant simply fire someone for what they have on a Facebook page but if that spills over and affects the classroom then you can take action he said Darlene Morris who runs a womens group that works with school parents said she was in disbelief when a parent showed her a printout of the Facebook comments before they were removed She identified the teacher as OBrien OBrien was a technology coordinator until this year when she was moved into the classroom as part of a staff reshuffling due to last years layoffs district officials said Her annual salary is 60513 according to the district I dont think of it as a white thing or a black thing Sixyearold children dont have rational minds they dont always do what we tell them to do Morris said If you have that kind of attitude toward a child youre in the wrong place because you cant help someone you dont like Best said he received several text messages from clergy and associates of the NAACP citing the Facebook posts This is not the first time Ive heard something like this from a teacher Best said Overall I think we have really good teachers But theres also a significant population of teachers here to collect the paycheck and dont have the best interests of the students in mind District investigating When asked about the suspension Superintendent Donnie Evans said Its a personnel matter and weve taken action There is an investigation under way Some community activists worry that such derogatory comments could damage the reputation of a neighborhood already plagued with poverty crime and singleparent households But one local pastor called the controversy an isolated incident and praised the elementary school overall for showing nothing but love for the children There might be others who share the sentiments expressed in the online remarks but all Ive dealt with have shown no signs like that said the Rev Barry Graham assistant pastor at Canaan Baptist Church on 22nd Street a block from the school Graham whose congregation works closely with the school and recently lauded 130 honor roll students there recognized that any one of us on a bad day could lash out But he said we cant have anyone with that attitude teaching our children Peter Tirri president of the local teachers union said he couldnt comment because he has not yet confirmed the Facebook postings But he added I cant imagine anybody has gone so far as to criticize 3000 teachers because of allegations against one New Jersey Education Association the statewide teachers union is providing the Paterson teacher with an attorney a spokesman said Trouble elsewhere Online postings have gotten teachers in trouble elsewhere In August a high school math and science supervisor in Massachusetts was forced to resign because of her Facebook comments describing students as germ bags and parents as snobby and arrogant And in February a high school English teacher in Bucks County Pa was suspended with pay and could lose her job because she called her students lazy whiners in a blog with only a handful of followers Annamaria Olmedo who has three children in School 21 said on Friday that many parents are using Facebook to tell other parents about the incident Some parents felt the suspension was too light and that she should not teach again Kids are going to be kids said Robin Smith aunt of School 21 student Yakira Robertson 11 She shouldve kept comments like that to herself Staff Writers Patricia Alex and Andrea Alexander contributed to this article '

aS'True Colors Bathing Mobile In An Entirely New Light\nEditors note Guest author Semil Shah is an entrepreneur interested in digital media consumer Internet and social networks He is based in Palo Alto and you can follow him on twitter semilshah Color Labs is assumed to be the newest combatant in the photosharing wars Many people ripped its floppy launch interface crashes and some are feeling creepy about the Chatroulette aspect Then there was the backlash to the backlash where believers applauded the vision risktaking and promise of mining metadata from phones Even with the latest update pushed out last night to address some of the initial products shortcomings Color remains the most polarizing Silicon Valley startup since Quoras rise and appropriately enough folks at Color have been answering questions on the companys Quora topic page The source of the furor varies from the amount of money raised 41m to the team size 27 to the buggy app despite updates A good chunk of the backlash is because users perceive it as a photosharing service But what if Color is more than a photosharing service Color Labs is on the record stating they are more of a data mining company with technology that operating in concert on the phone can paint a detailed mosaic of our mobility Its patentpending technologies are said to able to place users in proximity to others based on sounds and images can capture the angle at which we hold our phones how fast we move them in gestures and how bright the environment is And when users actually have the camera open thats when the real show begins tagging images setting context and opening the type of world Christopher Nolan conceived of in The Dark Knight when Lucius Fox and Bruce Wayne use cell phone triangulation to create a digital reflection of the real world At the same time Foursquare and Facebook are clamoring to obtain our location others already have a much better implicit depiction of our whereabouts and purchasing behaviors mainly credit card companies and phone companies For months Facebooks mobile apps have gently signaled to users if friends have been spotted nearby A few weeks ago Foursquare inked a groundbreaking deal with AMEX to tie the app to a payments system And a wellknown secret in Silicon Valley is that Facebook is hard at work building its own mobile operating system that will bake social into as many mobile devices as possible In order to get more information than credit card companies have the phone companies need the users assistance and permission And in the case of Color the user has to have the app running preferably with the camera open  at dinner at a sports game  along with all the other apps competing for attention in a crowded fragmented mobile apps marketplace Color could give phone companies the chance to get as much as or more information about us than the credit card companies have Before any of this can happen however the question looms Will Color be able to withstand this initial backlash iterate and keep improving on their app Some believe the team will find its way Others believe that in such a competitive environment its not possible to get a second chance The truth is that nobody knows but if Color weathers this initial storm and is successful what could it evolve into My sense is that Color Labs is thinking ahead two to three years by which time users may grow tired of sorting through a constellation of apps and services to share and broadcast their location purchases and pictures Instead these features will converge in a slightly smaller number of unified apps Well have folks using phones running on Android iOS or Facebook variants among others and well have a chance to leverage features from Color Labss systems This is what I believe Color Labs is going after The augmentation of mobile operating systems Ultimately they dont want their service to run as yet another fragmented app on your phone  they want their system to entirely augment mobile operating systems using their technologies to document every sound image movement transaction and message your phone transmits or receives The folks creating this system are building tools for a world in which our mobile phones and tablets will take the place of many of todays traditional computing devices In this world users will carry around their wallet books and other files in their phones and tablets docking them into monitors and screens as they move from location to location This is pure speculation on my part and nothing more than a fun attempt to connect some dots But if a seamless mobile operating experience is their ultimate goal this is the type of undertaking that truly needs venture capital and lots of it Part of the reason folks may be lashing out against the concept and launch is that frankly we havent seen a concept this big emerge for a while Everyone loves a big concept but a concept remains just that until the products gets in the hands of enough users to make a real impression Color Labs may be on a mission to perfect and harmonize its technologies to dramatically augment the mobile operating experience Its founders are accomplished its team is big its technologies are novel The brand is polarizing Its a company that can convince Sequoia Capital to invest about 18 of its current fund for the chance to build something fresh from the ground up Its a company thats being built entirely within a mobile world an attempt to test the lasting power of Facebooks symmetrical relationships and offer as Fred Wilson notes a more implicit or as the company notes elastic network one that is built with a different set of rules norms and permissions that could perhaps more accurately reflect the random ebbs and flows of our social interactions in real life that have yet to be captured fully by any digital network Photo credit FlickrPilottage '

Into this neighbourhood one of the worlds hottest social media companies has promised to stride offering urban rebirth in exchange for a tax break Taxe incentives to bring businesses to blighted streets are not unusual But this is San Francisco And Twitter The mayor supports the plan but progressive politicians  and now the citys largest public employee union  call the proposal a poorly crafted giveaway to the rich The conflict comes at a time when the citys high tech economy teems with energy not seen since before the first Internet bubble burst more than a decade ago At issue is the citys payroll tax San Francisco is the only city in California to levy its business tax based on how much companies pay workers rather than how much money they take in Since Twitter emerged as a side project of a San Francisco podcasting company in 2006 the business has grown from a handful of employees to a few hundred With investors pouring money into Twitter the company expects to grow to more than 3000 To do that Twitter needs a lot more space One option would be to flee to a sprawling suburban campus in Silicon Valley where adding more employees would not mean adding to the tax bill But earlier this month recently appointed Mayor Ed Lee announced what seemed like a winning solution for everyone Twitter had signed a letter of intent to sign a sixyear lease on several hundred thousand square feet of office space in a historic building in the struggling MidMarket neighbourhood The only condition The city must agree to exempt Twitter from paying any new payroll taxes on any additional hires For a company that expects to add thousands of new of employees in the next few years the savings would add up quickly This is the moment we have been waiting for Lee said of the proposed deal The transformative nature of an anchor tenant like Twitter will revitalize this community Yet in San Francisco where an overall economy largely untouched by the recession has kept real estate prices among the highest in the country some lowincome residents worry that revitalization will just lead to higher rents And city employees facing layoffs and contract concessions thanks to a massive budget shortfall resent what they see as a giveaway to venture capitalists and a bailout for landlords Who are the Twitter investors Supervisor John Avalos told The San Francisco Examiner Probably some of the wealthiest people in this country And we are giving them more wealth Last Tuesday members of a neighbourhood group protested outside Twitters current headquarters about a mile from the proposed new offices They accused Twitter of not living up to its pledge to be a good neighbour They complained neither the city nor the company have considered the lowincome residents who would be adversely impacted by rising rents spurred by the prosperity Twitter could bring The residents are feeling that if theyre not going to benefit from this revitalization that the city is

aS'Wheres that Verizon iPhone bump\nIf Apple sold 1 million Verizon iPhones in February it doesnt show in ComScores data Click to enlarge Data ComScore If you look very closely at the Feb 2011 data in the chart at right you will see slight uptick in the green line that represents Apples AAPL share of the US smartphone market Its a subtle change You might have to enlarge the chart by clicking to see it It reflects according to the ComScore data released Friday an increase in the iPhones market share from 247 in January to 252 in February  a month according to ComScore in which the Verizon iPhone was the bestselling smartphone in America I point this out because one of the great unsolved mysteries of the smartphone wars is the effect of the arrival in February of the longawaited iPhone for Verizon VZ Judging by ComScores data it didnt do much to slow the advance of Googles GOOG Android whose US market share rose that month from 312 to 33 And I would argue that it puts the lie to claims in the press that Verizon sold 1 million iPhones in the first two weeks of February Proving this is a little tricky because Apple doesnt break down iPhone sales by country Moreover what ComScore is reporting is market shares not actual unit sold in a market that itself is growing according to Gartner at a rate of more than 70 per year But here we go Using Gartners numbers 2966 million smartphones were shipped to US users in 2010 up from 172 million in 2009 and 466 million of them were iPhones That suggests that Apple was selling iPhones in the US last year at a rate of about 4 million per month and probably more toward the end of the year Lets assume conservatively that total smartphone sales in the US was 25 million in January and February of this year If it were true that the Verizon iPhone bumped Apples sales from 4 million units to more than 5 million in February Apples share of the market would have jumped at least 4 percentage points not the measly 05 ComScore observed This math here is pretty shaky Ill admit But it jibes with some firsthand observations Ive seen the kind of crowds that gather outside Apple Stores on those weekends that the company sells 1 million units of anything Even if as Verizon reports 60 of its initial sales were preordered online you would think if 400000 people showed up to buy iPhones between Feb 10 and Feb 13 someone would have spotted them Besides Verizon has been cagey  and Apple silent  about the size of the Verizon iPhone bump If 1 million iPhones had been purchased first weekend dont you think  given Steve Jobs penchant for nice round numbers  that Apple would have issued a press release We may finally get some answers on April 20 when Apple reports its earnings for the second quarter of 2011 Tune in here for our analysis Also on Fortunecom Why are the Verizon lines so short Verizon halts iPhone orders An estimated 100000 units presold Survey 44 of Verizon Android users likely to switch to iPhone on Day One Follow Philip ElmerDeWitt on Twitter philiped '

aS'Twitter Tax Deal Creates Classic San Francisco Row\nSAN FRANCISCO  In the shadow of San Franciscos stately City Hall sidewalks abound with transients drugs and crime Into this neighborhood one of the worlds hottest social media companies has promised to stride offering urban rebirth in exchange for a tax break Tax incentives to bring businesses to blighted streets are not unusual But this is San Francisco And Twitter The mayor supports the plan but progressive politicians  and now the citys largest public employee union  call the proposal a poorly crafted giveaway to the rich The conflict comes at a time when the citys high tech economy teems with energy not seen since before the first Internet bubble burst more than a decade ago At issue is the citys payroll tax San Francisco is the only city in California to levy its business tax based on how much companies pay workers rather than how much money they take in Since Twitter emerged as a side project of a San Francisco podcasting company in 2006 the business has grown from a handful of employees to a few hundred With investors pouring money into Twitter the company expects to grow to more than 3000 To do that Twitter needs a lot more space One option would be to flee to a sprawling suburban campus in Silicon Valley where adding more employees would not mean adding to the tax bill But earlier this month recently appointed Mayor Ed Lee announced what seemed like a winning solution for everyone Twitter had signed a letter of intent to sign a sixyear lease on several hundred thousand square feet of office space in a historic building in the struggling MidMarket neighborhood The only condition The city must agree to exempt Twitter from paying any new payroll taxes on any additional hires For a company that expects to add thousands of new of employees in the next few years the savings would add up quickly This is the moment we have been waiting for Lee said of the proposed deal The transformative nature of an anchor tenant like Twitter will revitalize this community Yet in San Francisco where an overall economy largely untouched by the recession has kept real estate prices among the highest in the country some lowincome residents worry that revitalization will just lead to higher rents And city employees facing layoffs and contract concessions thanks to a massive budget shortfall resent what they see as a giveaway to venture capitalists and a bailout for landlords Who are the Twitter investors Supervisor John Avalos told The San Francisco Examiner Probably some of the wealthiest people in this country And we are giving them more wealth Last Tuesday members of a neighborhood group protested outside Twitters current headquarters about a mile from the proposed new offices They accused Twitter of not living up to its pledge to be a good neighbor They complained neither the city nor the company have considered the lowincome residents who would be adversely impacted by rising rents spurred by the prosperity Twitter could bring The residents are feeling that if theyre not going to benefit from this revitalization that the city is pushing for it really doesnt make sense for these companies to stay in San Francisco said Angelica Cabande director of South of Market Community Action Network Twitter declined to comment on the taxbreak fracas As a result of the controversy a lawmaker on the Board of Supervisors progressive wing Ross Mirkarimi has proposed an alternative measure he says will fix an underlying legal flaw that has led to anxiety among hot tech companies looking to grow San Franciscos payroll tax is unusual enough but one provision makes it even more unique The city in 2004 added language to the tax code to make clear that tax collectors considered stock options a part of employees compensation and hence taxable as part of the payroll For tech startups stock options are one of the most common ways to hold onto employees especially when a lack of funds doesnt allow them to offer competitive salaries When lucky companies reach a point where they can make their initial public offering of stock those options can turn into a major windfall for workers But for companies in San Francisco that windfall sticks employers with a huge tax increase right at the time theyve issued the stock in an effort to expand Mirkarimis proposal would place a twoyear moratorium on taxing any companys stock options to ease the fears not just of Twitter but other San Franciscobased startups like social gaming leader Zynga and consumer review website Yelp You dont want to write law in a way that only helps one company or one neighborhood in one part of the city Mirkarimi said The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote Tuesday on the Twitter package and Mirkarimi predicts it will pass even without his vote If that happens Service Employees International Union Local 1021 the public employees union may seek a ballot measure that could delay the deal until voters weigh in City economic officials paint any failure of the deal not as a loss to Twitter but as a loss for the neighborhood where more than half of the available commercial real estate sits vacant While Twitter is the big fish the city is seeking to catch any businesses within the geographic zone defined by the legislation would get a similar tax break The benefit we want which is jobs in this area is not happening without some incentive said Jennifer Matz director of the citys Office of Economic and Workforce Development Without such incentives she said the neighborhood has not seen improvement for a generation It resisted the last dotcom boom '

aS'Sony CEO Accidentally Reveals Secret Details about iPhone 5\nSir Howard Stringer CEO of Sony accidentally told everyone in the world that his company will be supplying image sensors for Apples iPhone 5 In an interview late Friday with the Wall Street Journals Walt Mossberg the Sony chief was talking about earthquake damage to 15 of the Sonys factories in Japan and inadvertently mentioned that a camera sensor made in one of those plants is on its way to Apple and that sensor would be delayed because of the quake and tsunami Stringer didnt specifically say that Sony is building an 8megapixel image sensor that will go into the iPhone 5 but since Sony is currently not manufacturing any image sensors for Apple this confirmed that Sony plans to supply components of the iPhone 5 This points to the distinct possibility that in the iPhone 5 Apple will no longer be using those OmniVision 5megapixel image sensors currently inside the iPhone 4 This is supported by an analysts report from February of this year saying that OmniVision might lose out on supplying cameras for the iPhone 5 because OmniVisions 8megapixel sensor wont be ready for the iPhone 5s rumored midsummer launch Because Stringer was talking about the irony of supplying the companys best camera to Apple we can only surmise that he was talking about an 8megapixel sensor Heres what The Wall Street Journal wrote about Stringers quote when reporting on its own event this morning Early on he raised the irony of Sony supplying camera components for Apple devices It always puzzles me he said Why would I make Apple the best camera It is unclear what devices he was talking about as Sony isnt known to supply key camera components known as image sensors to Apple A Sony spokeswoman declined to comment and an Apple spokesperson couldnt be reached for comment Stringers inadvertent slip also lends credence to the rumors of a delayed release of the iPhone 5 So what do you think readers Is this enough evidence for us to bet on a Sony 8megapixel camera going into the iPhone 5 '

aS'Why Microsoft filed a formal complaint about Google and the search giants reponse\nMicrosoft has made its firstever formal complaint to antitrust regulators in the Euroean Union alleging that Google systematically thwarts Internet search competition This is how Microsoft and Google responded to the complaint Microsoft Competition must be fair Posted by Brad Smith Senior vicepresident  general counsel March 30 2011 Microsoft is filing a formal complaint with the European Commission as part of the Commissions ongoing investigation into whether Google has violated European competition law At the outset we should be among the first to compliment Google for its genuine innovations of which there have been many over the past decade Google has done much to advance its laudable mission to organise the worlds information but were concerned by a broadening pattern of conduct aimed at stopping a competitive alternative Weve therefore decided to join a large and growing number of companies registering their concerns about the European search market By the European Commissions own reckoning Google has about 95pc of the search market in Europe This contrasts with the United States where Microsoft serves about a quarter of Americans search needs either directly through Bing or through our partnership with Yahoo Our filing today focuses on a pattern of actions that Google has taken to entrench its dominance in the markets for online search and search advertising to the detriment of European consumers How does it do this Google has built its business on indexing and displaying snippets of other organisations web content It understands that search engines depend upon the openness of the web to function properly and its quick to complain when others undermine this Search engines compete to index the web as fully as possible to generate good search results they compete to gain advertisers  the source of revenue in this business  and distribution of their search boxes through websites Consumers will not benefit from clicking to alternative sites unless all search engines have a fair opportunity to compete in each of these areas Our filing details many instances where Google is impeding competition for instance since Google acquired YouTube in 2006 it has put in place a growing number of technical measures to restrict competing search engines from properly accessing it for their search results Microsoft recognises the importance of ensuring that competition laws remain balanced and that technology innovation moves forward Google We try to be as open as we can Posted by Matt Cutts Principal engineer Search Quality Team March 2 2010 Recently the European Commission opened a preliminary inquiry into competition complaints Part of the complaint alleges that Google operates without sufficient transparency into how and why websites rank in our search results The notion that Google isnt transparent is tough for me to swallow One of the most widelydiscussed parts of Googles scoring has always been PageRank That secret ingredient is hardly a secret An early paper not only gave the formula for PageRank but mentioned many of the other signals in Googles ranking including anchor text the location of words within documents the relative proximity of query words in a document the size and type of fonts used the raw HTML of each page and capitalisation of words Google has continued to publish literally hundreds of research papers over the years Those papers reveal many of the secret formulas for how Google works and document essential infrastructure that Google uses Some of these papers have spurred not only opensource projects but entire companies in their own right Academic papers are one thing but Google also aims to engage and educate in many other ways In 1999 Sergey Brin Google cofounder participated in the first Search Engine Strategies conference for webmasters In 2001 Google became one of the first search engines to engage online at a publisher forum called WebmasterWorld Weve tried all sorts of experiments to help site owners understand how Googles search ranking works Weve done multiple live webmaster chats online with hundreds of simultaneous participants We also engage online across the blogosphere to answer questions about Googles practices The list goes on and on At Google we try to be as open as we can even to the point of helping users export their data out of Googles products At the same time we dont think its unreasonable for any business to have some trade secrets not least because we dont want to help spammers and crackers game our system Ultimately criticising Google for its secret formula is an easy claim to make but it just isnt true '
